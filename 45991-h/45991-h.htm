<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chI' class='c007'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br />AN IMPORTANT COMMISSION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Come in!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gray-haired man who uttered these words gazed
sharply up at the door of the private office of the
Secretary of the Navy’s Bureau, at Washington, D. C.,
as he spoke. He was evidently anticipating callers of
more than usual importance judging from his expectant
look. The old negro who had knocked opened
the door and respectfully stood waiting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Pinckney?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dey have come, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah; good,—show them in at once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old negro bowed respectfully and withdrew.
A few seconds later he reappeared and ushered in two
bright looking youths of sixteen and fourteen with the
announcement in a pompous tone of voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Messrs. Frank and Harry Chester.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank, the elder of the two brothers, was a well set
up youngster with crisp, wavy brown hair and steady
gray eyes. Harry, his junior by two years, had the
same cool eyes but with a merrier expression in them.
He, like Frank, was a well-knit, broad-shouldered
youth. Both boys were tanned to an almost mahogany
tinge for they had only returned a few days before
from Nicaragua, where they had passed through a
series of strange adventures and perils in their air-ship,
the <em>Golden Eagle</em>, perhaps, before her destruction in
an electric storm, the best known craft of her kind in
the world and one which they had built themselves
from top plane to landing wheels.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Secretary of the Navy, for such was the office
held by the gray-haired man, looked at the two youths
in front of him with some perplexity for a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are the Boy Aviators we have all heard so
much of?” he inquired at length with a note of
frank incredulity in his voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are, sir,” rejoined Frank, with just the ghost
of a smile playing about his lips at the great man’s
evident astonishment—and its equally evident cause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg your pardon,” hastily spoke up the Secretary
of the Navy, who had observed Frank’s amusement;
“but you seem——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know what you were thinking, sir,” interrupted
Frank, “that we are very young to undertake such
exacting service as Admiral Kimball outlined to us in
Nicaragua.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have guessed just right, my boy,” rejoined
the other, with a hearty laugh at Frank’s taking
his thoughts and putting them into such exact words,
“but your youth has evidently not interfered with
your progress if all the reports I have heard of you are
true. Sit down,” he went on, “and we will talk over
the proposal the Department has to make to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys set down their straw hats and seated themselves
in two chairs facing the grizzled official. Both
listened attentively as he began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When Admiral Kimball wrote to me about you,
telling me that he had found in the two sons of Planter
Chester of Nicaragua the very agents we wanted for a
particularly dangerous and difficult mission,” he said,
“I at once sent for you to come here from New York
to see for myself if his judgment was correct. I have
not been disappointed—”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys colored with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My brief observation of you has confirmed to my
mind his report and I am going to entrust to you the
responsibility of this undertaking. Now,” he went
on impressively, “the government has been experimenting
for some time in secret with Chapinite, a
new explosive of terrific power, the invention—as its
name makes apparent—of Lieut. Bob Chapin of the
United States Navy. I say ‘has been experimenting’
advisedly. It is so no more.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The formula of the explosive has disappeared
from the archives of the department and, what is still
more serious, Lieutenant Chapin himself is missing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The agents of the Secret Service force have
worked in vain on the case without discovering much
more than the one very important fact that the
government of a far Eastern power has recently been
experimenting with an explosive whose effects and
manifestations make it almost undoubted that the stuff
is Chapinite. By a tedious process of observation and
deduction the men have traced the shipments as far as
the west Florida coast but there all clues have ended.
Weeks of work have left us as much in the dark as
ever as to the location of the source of supply of the far
Eastern power. But that somewhere within the
untracked wildernesses of the Everglades a plant has
been set up in which Chapinite is being manufactured
in large quantities is a practical certainty to my mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is useless for the secret service men to attempt
to explore what is still an unmapped labyrinth of
swamp and jungle and above all it would occupy time.
What we have to do is to act quickly. I racked my
brain for days until I happened to come across a paragraph
in a newspaper calling attention to your wonderful
flights in the <em>Golden Eagle</em>, and then followed
Admiral Kimball’s dispatch. It struck me at
once that here indeed was a way of locating these men
that might prove feasible—I say ‘might’ because if
you boys accept the commission I do not want to absolutely
impose the condition of success upon you. All
that we shall expect of you is that you will do your
best.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you accept the assignment?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The blunt question almost took the boys off their
feet so to speak. They exchanged glances and then
Frank said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“As you perhaps know, sir, our first aeroplane, the
<em>Golden Eagle</em>——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In which you rescued William Barnes, a
newspaper correspondent, from a camp in which he was
held prisoner,” remarked the Secretary—“you see I
have followed your doings closely.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Exactly,” went on Frank; “that first <em>Golden
Eagle</em> is at the bottom of the sea. She went down
when we were driven off the land in a tropical electric
storm and it was only the fact that she was equipped
with wireless, with which we signaled a passing
steamer, that saved us from sharing her fate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We might, however, construct a second one. In
fact I have the designs partially drawn up. She would
be a more powerful craft than the first and capable of
even longer sustained flights.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The very thing!” exclaimed his listener enthusiastically,
“then you will accept the commission?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not yet said that we would,” rejoined
Frank, calmly. “As you have described the situation
it looks rather like a wild-goose chase; however, I
think that if my brother agrees that we might consent
to try to do our best.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I agree, Frank,” cried Harry enthusiastically.
The very mention of anything that promised
exciting adventures was sufficient to enlist
Harry’s ardent interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it is as good as settled,” concluded the Secretary.
“The thing is now, how long will it take you
to build this craft?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We shall require at least three weeks,” replied
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Secretary almost groaned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a long time—or at least it seems so,” he corrected,
“when there is so much at stake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would be quite impossible to construct a suitable
aeroplane in a lesser period;” rejoined Frank, with
finality in his tones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I suppose we shall have to exercise patience,”
remarked the secretary. “You will of course
need funds. How much shall you require do you suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We cannot build a second <em>Golden Eagle</em> for less
than ten thousand dollars to start with,” was the quiet
reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ten thousand dollars?” repeated the secretary, in
tones of amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It does sound like a good deal of money,” replied
Frank, “but if you were more familiar with aeroplane
construction you would see that it is not exorbitant.
Everything that enters into the construction of an air
craft must be of the very best and strongest material.
The engine alone is a heavy item of expense and besides
must be of specially prepared metals and hand
machined.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see,” replied the secretary. “You know best.
I will see that arrangements are made to provide you
with everything you require. Where do you intend
to build the ship?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is a place at White Plains, some miles out
from the town and back in the hills,” replied Frank,
“that is in every way suited for our purpose. It is
off any main road and we can work there in quiet.
We built the first <em>Golden Eagle</em> there and I don’t think
that outside of ourselves and our workmen half a
dozen people knew about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The very thing,” replied the secretary. “Of
course I need not impress upon you the importance of
absolute secrecy in this matter. We have almost positive
proof that our every movement is watched by
agents of those who have stolen the plans, and who
now have Lieutenant Chapin a prisoner—that is, if
they have not made away with him, poor fellow. My
own idea is, however, that he has been kidnapped and
forced to take charge of the work, as without his
direction it would be impossible, even with the aid of
the formula, to manufacture the explosive. What I
fear is, that after they have made a sufficient quantity
to stock up the arsenals of the far Eastern power they
will destroy their plant and end Lieutenant Chapin’s
life. You see the explosive is so powerful that even
a small quantity would make the nation possessing it
extremely formidable, therefore it is not likely that
wherever they have set up their plant they are figuring
on a permanent location.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the last trace you have of the plotters?”
asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>For answer the secretary pressed a bell that stood on
his table at his elbow. When in response the bowing
old negro appeared he said sharply:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Send Flynn here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Flynn turned out to be a thick-set, red-faced man
with the neck of a bull and powerful physique. He
was one of the most trusted men in the Secret Service
Bureau.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Flynn,” said the secretary when the detective had
introduced his huge bulk, “these young men are Frank
and Harry Chester, the <em>Boy Aviators</em>, they are going
to take up your work where you left it off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only because we were up against a dead wall,”
protested the agent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite so—quite so; I meant no offence. I know
that you did all it was humanly possible to accomplish.
What I want you to do now is to outline to these young
men the discoveries you made following the morning
on which we found the safe opened and the plans gone,—to
be followed a few hours later by the discovery
that Lieutenant Chapin had also vanished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Flynn, “cutting out the minor details
we discovered that the very same day a big white
yacht had cleared from New York without papers and
had headed toward the south. We traced her up and
found that she had been bought by a Mr. Brownjohn
of Beaver Street. We looked him up and found he
was a ship broker who had bought the craft on telegraphed
instructions from Washington. We trailed
up the telegram and found that it had been sent from
the Hotel Willard by a Captain Mortimer Bellman,
who, from what we can find out about him, was considerable
of an adventurer and had at one time lived
a good deal in the far East. In fact he had only
recently come from there. At the Marine Basin at
Ulmer Park, near Coney Island, we discovered that a
nondescript sort of a crew had been hustled on board
and that the yacht had sailed at night without papers
a few hours after her purchase was completed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ten days later the newspapers reported that a
large yacht had gone ashore on one of the Ten Thousand
Islands on the west coast of the Everglades, and
the men we sent down there to investigate discovered
that the derelict was the Mist,—the same yacht that
Bellman had bought. What was most remarkable,
however, was that the boat seemed to have been deliberately
wrecked, for everything had been taken off her
except her coal and ballast and all the boats were gone.
There was no indication that she had been abandoned
in a hurry and the reef on which she lay was such an
obvious one that even at high water it was clearly
visible. Now that the Mist’s boats went into the Everglades
we are reasonably sure. If they had gone anywhere
else we should have got some trace of them by
this time, but from that day to this we have not had a
word or sign concerning them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have heard, however, that the navy of the
power we suspect has been conducting experiments
with a new explosive and we have also learned that this
same explosive is undoubtedly Chapinite. We have
looked up Bellman’s record and find that while he was
stopping at the Willard he received several letters from
the government in question and that he paid twenty
thousand dollars for the Mist. Now a man isn’t going
to pay that much out for a boat and wreck her unless
he does it purposely. Bellman didn’t have that much
money anyhow. There is only one conclusion, Bellman
was simply the agent for some one else and that some
one has got a lot of money to spend to secure the most
powerful explosive ever discovered.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There you have the case in a nutshell,” remarked
the secretary as Flynn concluded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is only one thing that is not clear to me,”
objected Frank. “Why should they make the stuff in
the Everglades. Why not manufacture it out and out
in the country you have mentioned?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Such a course would have been too full of risks,”
replied the secretary, “we are at peace with that power
and if the stolen formula had been discovered there it
would have led to a serious international breach and
possibly war. By manufacturing it here and shipping
it secretly in small quantities the plotters secure
safety from war to their own country.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see,” nodded Frank. He pulled out his watch.
It was twelve o’clock. “There is a train to New York
at one o’clock,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t you stop and have lunch with me?” asked
the secretary.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thank you,” was the boys’ reply; “you see we
have a lot of work before us. Building an aeroplane
in three weeks calls for some tall hustling.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c007'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br />THE BOYS MEET AN OLD FRIEND,—AND AN ENEMY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>As the boys hurried from the office of the Secretary
of the Navy they almost collided with a plump faced,
spectacled young man in an aggressively loud suit of
light summer clothes who was just rushing in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say, look out where you are coming, can’t you?”
he was beginning when he broke off with a cry of delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next minute the boys were wringing the hand of
Billy Barnes the youthful newspaper reporter who had
been with them in Nicaragua and whose life they had
saved when he was a captive among the Nicaraguans.
Boy fashion the three slapped each other on the back
and went through a continuous pump-handle performance
at this unexpected meeting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What on earth are you doing here?” asked Harry
when the first enthusiasm of the greetings had worn
off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Working,” replied Billy briefly. “I’m on the
Washington Post.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I thought you were going to take a holiday
after you had realized your money on the sale of your
share of the rubies we found in the Toltec cave;”
said Frank wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” rejoined Billy, “of course the money I
got for my two rubies looked good and it feels pretty
nifty to have a check-book in your inside pocket; but
I guess I can’t be happy unless I’m working. I bought
my mother up the state a pretty little place in Brooklyn
and tried to settle down to be a young gentleman
of leisure but it wouldn’t do. I wasn’t happy. Every
time I saw the fire-engines go by or read a good
thrilling story in the paper I wanted to be back on the
job, so I just got out and hustled about for one and
here I am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what are you doing at the office of the Secretary
of the Navy,” demanded the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, that’s just it,” rejoined Billy mysteriously,
“I’m on the track of the biggest story of my career
and I think it’s a scoop. Can you fellows keep a
secret?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can do better than that,” laughed Frank, “we
can tell you one. What would you say if we could
tell you your errand here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That you are pretty good mind-readers,” retorted
Billy promptly. “I can guess yours though. You are
here to try to sell the government an air-ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wrong,” shouted Frank triumphantly. “But you—William
Barnes—” he went on, making a mysterious
pass at the other boy’s head, “you are here to
find out about Lieutenant Chapin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How on earth did you know that?” gasped Billy,
“you are right though. Do you know anything about
it?” he inquired anxiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, come off, Frank,” retorted Billy, “that’s too
much. How on earth can you—?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That matters not, my young reporter—we do,”
struck in Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give me the story then, will you?” begged Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, we can’t do that,” replied Frank in a graver
tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, of course I wasn’t trying to worm it out of
you,” said Billy abashed somewhat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We know that, Billy,” said Harry kindly. The reporter
looked at him gratefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I just thought you might have something to give
out,” went on Billy. “I see that you are in the confidence
of the naval department.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Billy,” continued Frank, “we can’t give you
anything for publication. But we can do better than
that, we can tell you we are about to start on what may
prove the most exciting trip we have ever undertaken.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” questioned Billy seeing
clearly by Frank’s manner that something very unusual
was in the wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That we are going to try to find Lieutenant Chapin
and the men who kidnapped him,” replied Frank; “but
come along, Billy, we’ve just an hour before train time
and if you feel like having a bite of lunch come with
us and we can talk it over as we go along.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young reporter gladly assented and, linked arm
in arm, the three boys passed out onto the sunny
avenue which was glowing in the bright light of a
late May day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank rapidly detailed to Billy the gist of their conversation
with the Secretary of the Navy, having first
called up that official on the telephone and secured his
permission to enlist Billy as a member of the expedition.
For Frank had made up his mind that the
reporter was to come along almost as soon as the boys
encountered him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young journalist could hardly keep from giving
a “whoop,” which would have sadly startled the sedate
lunchers at the Willard, as Frank talked. He
resisted the temptation, however, and simply asked
eagerly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“When do you start?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys told him. They could see the eager question
framing itself on Billy’s lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, Frank, couldn’t you take me along?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank feigned an elaborate indifference.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I don’t know,” he replied, winking at Harry
as Billy’s face fell at this apparent refusal, “we might,
of course, but really I think we shall have to go ‘without
a chronicler.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys might have kept the jest up but Billy’s
face grew so lugubrious that they had not the heart to
keep him in suspense any longer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you would care to come we were sort of thinking
of taking you,” laughed Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I would care to come?” gasped Billy, “Jimminy
crickets! If I’d care to come! Say, just wait a
minute while I go to ’phone my resignation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What an impetuous chap you are,” laughed Frank,
“we don’t start for three weeks yet and here you are
in a hurry to throw up your job to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” replied Billy somewhat abashed, “I was a
bit previous. But it’s so white of you chaps to take me
along that I hardly know what I’m doing. How I’m
to wait three weeks I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How would you like to help us build the <em>Golden
Eagle II</em>?” asked Frank suddenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, Frank,” burst out Billy earnestly, “you are
a trump. That was just the very thing I longed to do
but I didn’t have the nerve to ask you after you were
so decent about taking me with you to Florida. I
don’t know how to thank you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It won’t be all a picnic,” laughed Frank. “We’ve
got a lot of hard work ahead of us and we’ll all have to
pitch in and take a hand, share and share alike.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can count on me,” exclaimed the reporter
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know we can,” replied Frank, “or we would not
have asked you to accompany us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are your plans?” asked Billy eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At present so far as I have thought them out,” replied
Frank, “we shall sail from New York for Miami
about the middle of June. I think it will be best to
go by steamer as we can keep a better watch on any
suspicious fellow passengers in that way than if we
went by train. The key on which the Mist was wrecked
is on the opposite coast from there, I understand, and
the men who kidnapped Chapin and stole the plans
must have entered the Everglades by one of the numerous
small rivers that lead back from the coast at
the Ten Thousand Island Archipelago.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My idea, then, is to establish a permanent camp
from which we can work, the location of course to depend
entirely on circumstances, that may arise after we
reach our destination. We are going into this thing
practically blindfold you see, and so we shall have to
leave the arrangement of a host of minor details till we
arrive there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean to strike right back into the wilderness?”
asked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As soon as possible after our arrival at Miami,”
was the businesslike rejoinder. “Every minute of
our time will be precious. Oh, there’s heaps to be
done,” broke off Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the boys had to laugh heartily at the wave of the
hands with which Frank accompanied his last words.
But their merriment was cut short by a sharp exclamation
from Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say, Frank,” whispered the young reporter,
“have you noticed that fellow at the next table?” He
indicated a short dark sallow-faced man sitting at a
table a few feet from them and to whom most of their
conversation must have been audible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s not a beauty,” remarked Harry in the same
low tone; “what about him, Billy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said the reporter seriously, “I may be
wrong and I may not—and I rather think I’m not,—but
if he hasn’t been listening with all his ears to what
we’ve been saying I’m very much mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank bit his lip with vexation. In their enthusiasm
the youthful adventurers had been foolishly discussing
their plans in tones which any one sitting near could
have overheard without much difficulty. The boys
realized this and also that if the man really turned out
to have been an eavesdropper that they had involuntarily
furnished him with much important information
about their plans.</p>

<p class='c009'>The object of their suspicion apparently saw that
they had observed him, for as they resumed their talk
in lowered tones he called for his bill and having paid
it with a hand that flashed with diamonds, he left the
dining-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you seen him before?” asked Frank of Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was trying to think,” replied the reporter. “It
seems to me that I have. I am almost certain of it in
fact. But I can’t think where.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Try to think,” said Frank, “it may be very important.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy cudgeled his brains for a few minutes and
then snapped his fingers in triumph.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve got it,” he exclaimed joyously. “I’ve seen
him hanging around the Far Eastern embassy. I was
up there the other day to report a reception and this
fellow was wandering around as if he hadn’t got a
friend in the world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He might have had an object in that,” said Frank
gravely. “There is no doubt that he was listening to
what we were talking about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And not much question that he heard every word
of it,” put in Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it can’t be helped,” said Frank in an annoyed
tone, “we shall have to be more cautious in the future.
I see that the secretary was right, this place is swarming
with spies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should say it is,” replied Billy, “Washington is
more full of eavesdroppers and secret-service men of
various kinds than any other city in the world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>If the boys had seen the bediamonded man hasten
from the hotel direct to a Western Union telegraph
office where he filed a long telegram, they would have
been even more worried than they were. If in addition
they had seen the contents of the message they
would have been tempted, it is likely, to have abandoned
the expedition or at least their present plans, for
the message, which was addressed to “Mr. Job Scudder,
Miami, To Be Called For,” and signed Nego, gave
about as complete an account of what they intended to
do as even Billy Barnes with his trained ear for catching
and marshaling facts could have framed. There
was a very amiable smile on Mr. Nego’s face as he left
the telegraph office and drew on a pair of light chamois
gloves that gave a finishing touch of fashion to his
light gray spring clothes, whose every line bore evidence
to the fact that they had come from one of the
best tailors in Washington. He had done a good
morning’s work.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys of course had no means of knowing that,
even as they hurried to their train, the wires were
rushing to Florida the news of their coming three
weeks before they planned to start and even if they
had been aware of it they could not then have stopped
it. With Billy Barnes they dashed up to the Pennsylvania
depot in a taxi-cab just as the big locomotive
of the Congressional Limited was being backed up
to the long train of vestibuled coaches. They had
their return tickets so that there was no delay at the
ticket window and they passed directly into the depot,
and having found their chair car deposited themselves
and their hand-baggage in it. Billy stayed chatting
with them till the conductor cried “all aboard.” As
the reporter rose to leave he gave a very perceptible
start. He had just time to cry to Frank:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look behind you,” when the wheels began to revolve
and Billy only avoided being carried off by
making a dash for the door almost upsetting the
colored porter in his haste.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the train gathered speed Frank glanced round
as if in search of somebody. He almost started, as
had Billy, as his eyes encountered the direct gaze of
the very black orbs of the man whom they were certain
had overheard their conversation at lunch and
who had signed the telegram “Nego.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c007'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br />A TRAMP WITH FIELD-GLASSES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The boys lost no time in explaining to their mother
when they reached their home on Madison Avenue the
nature of the enterprise in which they had enlisted
their services. That she was unwilling at first for them
to embark on what seemed such a dangerous commission
goes without saying, but after a lot of persuasion
she finally yielded and gave her consent and the delighted
boys set out at once for White Plains where
the large aerodrome in which they had constructed the
<em>Golden Eagle I</em> was still standing. The place was
equipped with every facility for the construction of
air craft and so no time was lost in preliminaries and
two days of hard work saw the variadium steel framework
of the <em>Golden Eagle the Second</em> practically complete.</p>

<p class='c009'>The craft was to be a larger one than the <em>Golden
Eagle I</em>, which had a wing-spread of fifty-six feet.
The planes of her successor were seventy feet from
tip to tip and equipped with flexible spring tips that
played a very important part in assuring her stability
in the air. Like the first <em>Golden Eagle</em> the boys had
determined that the new ship, should carry wireless
and the enthusiasm of Schultz and Le Blanc, their two
assistants, was unbounded as Frank placed before
them his working drawings and blue prints which bore
on paper the craft which they expected to eclipse anything
ever seen or heard of in the aerial world for
speed and stability.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old <em>Golden Eagle</em> had been equipped with a
fifty horse-power double-opposed engine with jump
spark ignition. The boys for the new craft had determined
to invest in a one hundred horse-power machine
of similar type and equipped with the same ignition
apparatus. As in the other ship they planned to
have the driving power furnished by twin screws but,
whereas in the first ship the propellers had been of
oiled silk on braced steel frames in the new <em>Golden
Eagle</em> the screws were of laminated wood, razor sharp
at the edges and with a high pitch.</p>

<p class='c009'>Except for her increased size the <em>Golden Eagle II</em>
did not differ in other respects from her predecessor.
Her planes were covered with the same yellow-hued
balloon silk that had given the first craft her name and
the arrangement of pilot-house and navigating instruments
was much the same. The boys, however,
planned to give her a couple of low transoms running
the length of each side of the pilot-house on which the
occupants could sleep on cushions stuffed with a very
light grade of vegetable wool. A light aluminum
framework, which could be covered in with canvas in
bad weather, or mosquito netting in the tropics, forming
in the former case,—a weather-tight pilot-house
with a mica window in front for the steersman, was
another improved feature.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy Barnes was astonished when a few days later,
having resigned his newspaper job, he was met at
the White Plains station by Frank and Harry, and
found, on his arrival at the aerodrome a framework
which was rapidly beginning to assume very much the
look of a real air-ship. The enthusiastic reporter
crawled under it and round it and pulled it and poked
it from every possible angle till old Schultz, angrily
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ach, vas is dis boy crazy, hein?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy was nearly crazy with joy he exclaimed and
the old German’s heart warmed toward him for the
interest he displayed in the craft which Schultz regarded
as being as much his own creation as anyone
else’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you certainly look like business here,” exclaimed
Billy as he gazed about him. What with the
lathes, the work-tables, the blue prints and plans, the
shaded drop-lights and the small gasolene motor,—used
to test propellers and run the machinery of the
shop,—Frank and Harry were indeed as Billy said,
“running a young factory.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You picked out a private spot,” exclaimed Billy,
gazing out of the tall aerodrome doors at the low,
wooded hills that surrounded them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” laughed Frank, “if we hadn’t we’d have
half the population of White Plains around here trying
to get on to what we were doing and spreading all
sorts of reports.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, by the way,” asked Billy, “did you have any
more manifestations from our dark-skinned friend on
your way to New York?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” replied Frank, “he sat in his chair and read
the papers and apparently paid no more attention to
us. I really begin to think that we may have been
mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess so,” said Billy lightly; “maybe he was
just some rubber-neck who was surprised to hear
three boys talking so glibly about invading the Everglades
in an airship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With that the subject was dropped, for Harry, who
had just entered the workshop from the small barn
outside, where he had been putting the horse up, carried
Billy off to show him the “camp” as the boys
laughingly called it. The eating and sleeping quarters
were in a small portable house, a short distance from
the main aerodrome. It was divided into a dining
and a sleeping room. The latter neatly furnished
with three cots—a third having been added to Frank
and Harry’s for Billy’s use that very morning. On its
wall hung a few pictures of noted aviators, a shelf of
technical books on aviation and the usual odds and
ends that every boy likes to have about him. The two
mechanics took their meals in the house and slept in
the aerodrome. The cooking was done by Le Blanc
who, like most of his countrymen, was a first-rate chef.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Camp!” exclaimed the admiring Billy after he
had been shown over the little domain, “I call it a
mansion. Different from old Camp Plateau in Nicaragua,
eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you came very nearly been shaken out of
even that;” put in Harry with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should say so,” rejoined the reporter. “B-r-r-r-r!
it makes my teeth chatter now when I think of the
rain of stones that came from the Toltec ravine. By
the way,” he broke off suddenly, “where is good old
Ben Stubbs?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys laughed knowingly and exchanged
glances.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go ahead and tell him, Frank,” urged Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Frank, “as you know, Billy, we gave
Ben one of the rubies as his share of the loot of the
One-eyed Quesals and as a partial recognition of his
bravery in rescuing us from the White Serpents.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy nodded and waited eagerly for Frank to resume.
Ben Stubbs, the hardy ex-sailor, prospector
and adventurer, whom they had discovered marooned
in an inaccessible valley in the Nicaraguan Cordilleras,
was very dear to the hearts of all the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you suppose he did with the money after
he had sold the ruby for twelve thousand dollars?”
resumed Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reporter shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t guess,” he said; “bought a farm?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much,” chorused the boys, “he invested part
of the money in a tug-boat and has been doing well
with it in New York harbor. We met him when we
were in New York a couple of days ago and partially
outlined our plans to him. Nothing would do but he
must come along.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We couldn’t have a better camp-mate,” cried Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I agree with you,” said Frank. “So I told him
we’d think it over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, is he to come?” demanded Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be so impatient,” reproved Frank. “Listen
to this. I got it this morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He drew from his pocket a telegram and the boys
all shouted with laughter as he read it aloud. It was
characteristic of their old comrade.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have sold the tug and will be in White Plains to-morrow.
Ben Stubbs, (skipper retired).”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good for him,” cried Billy, as the three boys made
their way back from the living quarters to the aerodrome,
“he’s a trump.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know of anyone I would rather have along
in an emergency and on such an expedition as this,
his experience and resourcefulness will be invaluable
to us,” declared Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning Frank and Billy left the others
busy at the aerodrome applying the waterproof compound
to the <em>Golden Eagle II’s</em> planes and started for
town behind the venerable old steed that Billy had
christened “Baalbec,” because, he explained, “he
was a remarkably fine ruin.” The first train from
New York pulled into the station just as they were
driving into the town of White Plains and a minute
later the ears of both boys were saluted by a mighty
hail of:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahoy there, shipmates, lay alongside and throw
us a line.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The person from whom this unceremonious greeting
proceeded was a short, sun-bronzed man of about
fifty. He had an unusual air of confidence and ability
and his mighty muscles fairly bulged under the tight-fitting,
blue serge coat he wore. He carried an ancient
looking carpet bag in which as he explained he had
his “duds,” meaning his garments. The greetings
between the three were hearty and after Frank had
made a few purchases up-town and Ben had laid in a
good supply of strong tobacco they started for the
aerodrome.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they drove down the street a thick-set man, with
a furtive sallow face, came out of a store and as he
did so saw the boys. With the agility of an eel he
instantly slipped into a side street. But not so quickly
that Billy’s sharp eyes had not spied him and recognized
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bother that fellow,” he said with some irritation,
“he gets on my nerves. I wish to goodness he’d
keep away from where I am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank looked up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What on earth are you talking about, Billy?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why that fellow we saw at the Willard, and again
on the Congressional Limited,—or his double,—just
sneaked down a side street,” said Billy. “I am certain
he saw us and was anxious for us not to observe
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Meeting him a third time like this could hardly
be a coincidence,” mused Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much,” struck in Billy, “that fellow means
some mischief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think myself that he will bear watching,” replied
Frank, as they emerged from the street into the
open country.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pretty good for a week’s work, eh?” remarked
Harry with some pride as, after the joyous re-union
with Ben Stubbs, they all stood regarding the air-skimmer
which was growing like a living thing under
their hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>They all agreed enthusiastically and Frank even
suggested that it might be possible, at the rate the work
was progressing, to make the start in less time than he
had at first thought feasible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, by the way,” said Harry suddenly, “rather
a funny thing happened while you were gone, Frank!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes?” said the elder brother, “what was it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, nothing very exciting,” replied Harry, “nothing
more than a visit we had from a tramp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“From a tramp?” asked Frank wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, he came here to look for a job,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you told him—?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That we hadn’t any work, of course, and then,
apparently, he went away. But Schultz, when he
went over to the house for some tools he’d left there,
found that instead of going very far the fellow was
up in the wood back there and watching the place
with a pair of field-glasses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whew!” whistled Frank with a long face, “a
tramp with field-glasses?—that’s a novelty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I sent Schultz up to tell the man that he was
trespassing on private property,” went on Harry, “but
as soon as he saw the old fellow coming the tramp
made off. He, however, dropped this bit of paper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry handed his brother a crumpled sheet marked
with faint lines. Frank scrutinized the paper carefully
and a frown spread on his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This bit of paper, as you call it, Harry,” he said,
“is nothing more nor less than a very creditable sketch
map of the location of this aerodrome.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By jove, so it is,” exclaimed Harry, “how stupid
of me not to have realized that. What does it all
mean do you suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It means,” replied Frank, “that we will not leave
the aerodrome unguarded for a minute day or night
till we are ready to make our start for Florida.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c007'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br />A PLOT DISCOVERED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In accordance with Frank’s resolution the three
young members of the party and Ben Stubbs divided
the night into four watches which were religiously
kept, but rather to Frank’s surprise nothing occurred
to excite suspicion. The next morning Le Blanc, who
had driven into town, returned shortly before noon
with a letter from the Secretary of War which contained
information of much interest to every member
of the projected expedition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have arranged with the Department,” it read in
part, “to have the torpedo destroyer <em>Tarantula</em> detailed
to duty along the Florida coast and you can
keep in touch with her by wireless. For this purpose,
besides the apparatus attached to your air-ship, I have
ordered a complete field outfit to be forwarded to you,—of
the kind with which several western posts have
been experimenting of late and which has proved entirely
satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The instrumental part of the outfit—i. e., the keys,
detector, condenser, tuning-coil, etc., are permanently
fastened into or carried in a steel-bound trunk, but
little bigger than an ordinary steamer trunk, and
weighing about one hundred and fifty pounds. Two
storage batteries, both sufficient for ten hours of continuous
sending, accompany the outfit, and come in
wooden cases which form supports for the trunk when
the outfit is in use.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A mast of ten six-foot sections, which can be
jointed together and set up in a few minutes, forms
your aerial pole and each section is coppered so as to
provide a continuous conductor. In another box are
packed the aerial wires, extra rope, wire-pegs, etc., as
well as a waterproof tent to protect the outfit from
the weather. Of course a charging station is a necessity
and another case contains a small, but powerful
gasolene motor and generator. Another attachment
for use with the appliance is a combination Malay
and box kite carrying a cord of phosphor bronze, wire-woven
about a hemp center. There are eight hundred
feet of this wire wound on a reel. If for any reason
the work of setting up and attaching the pole and its
aerials is considered to be too lengthy an occupation
it is a simple matter to send up the kite, its wire rope
acting as an aerial in itself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys grew enthusiastic over this description.
The outfits seemed from the account to possess the
merits of portability and efficiency and in the country
into which they were going portability was a strong
feature in itself. It was this very question that had
caused Frank, when designing the new <em>Golden Eagle</em>,
to so construct her that she could be taken apart and
the various sections boxed in a very small capacity
each box weighing not more than fifty pounds with the
exception of that containing the engine which weighed
one hundred and fifty without the base.</p>

<p class='c009'>That afternoon the boys worked like Trojans on the
<em>Golden Eagle II</em> with the result that shortly before
sundown they had progressed to a point where the
air-ship was ready for the attachment of the engine.
They were all surprised, and somewhat startled, when
their solitude was invaded, just as they were thinking
of knocking off work for the day, by a loud rap at
the doors of the aerodrome. Frank opened the small
flap cut in the big door and stepped out to see who the
intruder might be.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was greeted by a boy of about his own years
smartly—too smartly—dressed, and with a confident
overbearing manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, hello, Lathrop Beasley,” exclaimed Frank,
with all the cordiality he could muster at seeing who
their visitor was,—and that was none too much,
“what are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess you’re surprised to see me,” rejoined the
other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I certainly am,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why don’t you ask me to come in,” went on the
other, “you’re a hospitable sort of fellow—not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg your pardon, Lathrop,” apologized Frank,
“won’t you come over to the house and sit down
awhile?”</p>

<p class='c009'>An unpleasant sort of smile broke on the other’s
face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, so you’re afraid to let me see your aeroplane
are you? Well, I don’t know that I care so much to
anyway. Since you fellows left New York I have
been made president of the Junior Aero Club and have
designed a ’plane that can beat anything you ever saw
into a cocked hat,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank smiled. He was used to Lathrop’s boasting
ways and at the Agassiz High School which they had
both attended had frequently seen the other humbled.
Now when Lathrop said that he didn’t care about seeing
the <em>Golden Eagle II</em>, of course he was not telling
the truth. He would have given a great deal to
have even caught a glimpse of her. In fact, when
that morning he had heard that the boys’ aerodrome
was once more occupied, he had determined to walk
over from his home, which was a splendid mansion
standing on a hill-top not far away, and take a look at
her for himself. That Frank should have objected to
showing him the craft was an obstacle that never entered
his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, come, Frank,” he went on, changing his tone,
“let me take a look at her, I won’t tell anyone about
it. What are you so secretive for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I myself should be glad to let you see the successor
to the <em>Golden Eagle</em> that we are building,” replied
Frank, “but my employers might not like it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lathrop pricked up his ears at this. He was an
ambitious boy and had designed several air-ships and
planes but he had never been able to speak of his
“employer.” The word must mean that Frank was
building the craft for some rich man. Although Lathrop
had plenty of it the idea that Frank and Harry
were making money out of their enterprise roused him
to a sullen sort of anger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh your employers mightn’t like it,” sneered Lathrop,
“I tell you what it is, Frank, I don’t believe you
have any ‘employers’ as you call it, and that all this
about a new air-ship is a bluff.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was a move intended to irritate Frank and
make him offer to show the air-ship as proof positive
that he was really at work on such a craft, but if
Lathrop had meant it in this way it was a failure.
Frank was quite unruffled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are welcome to believe what you like, Lathrop,”
he rejoined, “and now, as we are very busy, I
shall have to ask you to excuse me. I’ve got too much
work to do to stand talking here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s just like you, Frank Chester,” burst out the
other boy angrily, his temper quite gone now that he
saw that there was to be no opportunity of his seeing
the air-ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe you’ll be sorry that you wouldn’t show me
the ship—and before very long too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Frank, not caring to listen to more of this sort
of talk, re-entered the aerodrome the Beasley boy, almost
beside himself with anger, shouted after him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll remember this, Frank Chester, so look out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He strode angrily off through the woods making a
short cut for home. Lathrop was not a bad boy at
heart, but he was an intensely jealous one, and the
idea that the Boy Aviators were constructing an air-ship
that they refused to let him see irritated him almost
past bearing. When he shouted at Frank his
last words they were dictated by his anger, more than
by any real intention of carrying out any plan of
revenge for the fancied slight; but, as he strode along
through the woods, he suddenly heard voices that,
after a few minutes of listening, convinced him that
he was not the only person in the world who even
momentarily wished harm to the Chester boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll wreck the aerodrome to-night;” were the
words,—coming from within a clump of bushes that
grew to one side of the trail,—that attracted his attention.
The boy halted in his tracks as they were
uttered and then crept cautiously through the undergrowth
till he reached a spot from which he could
both see and hear without being seen. The man who
had uttered the threat that had brought him to a
standstill was a person bearing every evidence of being
of the genus—tramp, that is so far as his clothes
went. But his white hands and carefully kept nails
showed that he had assumed the rags he wore as a
disguise. His companion was a man of very different
appearance. He was in fact the natty person whom
the boys had seen at the Hotel Willard, and who had
since been on their track, as Frank had guessed when
Billy had spied his escaping figure in White Plains the
day before. With a beating heart the concealed boy
listened as the two plotters went on.</p>

<p>Lathrop discovers the plot.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think they have the machine finished
yet?” asked the better dressed of the two.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Confound them, they were too sharp to let me go
to work for them or I might have had the plans of it
by this time,” rejoined the other. “I think, though,”
he resumed, “that it must be so far advanced that if
we can wreck it now we will delay their departure for
Florida till we have been able to destroy the plant and
escape.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I owe them a debt of gratitude for the loud way
they talked at the Hotel Willard,” said the other.
“Thank goodness we are now in possession of their
plans at any event. Don’t you think we might head
them off without destroying the aerodrome? It’s
risky, and means jail for us if we are caught.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The other gave a short laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, we’ll hit them a body blow,” he said. “If I
could blow them up along with their air-ship I’d gladly
do it. I’d like to treat them as we mean to do with
that white-livered Lieutenant when we get through
with his services.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are they going to kill him?” demanded the other
with something like awe in his tones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” replied the man in the tramp’s rags, “not
unless he gives too much trouble. They are going to
put him to work in the sulphur mines of Ojahyama
and let him slave for his living.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Even from where he was the concealed boy could
see the other shudder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a terrible place,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is the best place for men of his caliber,”
retorted the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps it would be as happy a fate for him as
being compelled to slave for Foyashi.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hear that he would not have anything to do
with their schemes and defied them to kill him before
he would aid them to manufacture his explosive
until he was influenced by Foyashi,” said the first
speaker.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess you’re right,” replied the other worthy,
“but he’s passive enough now, I fancy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They both laughed and arose to go. As for Lathrop
he lay almost paralyzed with fear. Of course much
of what he had heard had been meaningless to him,
but he did understand that a plan was on foot to blow
up the boys’ aerodrome, destroy their ship and possibly
injure themselves. As the men’s footsteps died
out, as they walked off down the path through the
woods, the boy, who a minute before had been
seriously pondering some sort of harm to Frank and
Harry felt conscience-stricken.</p>

<p class='c009'>What he had just heard had changed him from a
possible enemy into a fellow-schoolmate and he determined
to warn the boys of their peril. With this end
in view he was hurrying down the path, retracing
his steps towards the aerodrome, when he was seized
roughly from behind and whirled about. The man
who had seized him was the one who had assumed the
costume of a tramp. His eyes blazed with rage. He
had hurried back to get his knife,—which had dropped
from his pocket as he sat talking,—a few seconds after
Lathrop had left his place of concealment. As luck
would have it, in pushing through the bushes he had
discovered the depression in the grass where the boy
had lain. A brief investigation showed him that it
had been recently occupied and that whoever had
crouched there must have heard every word they said.
Calling his comrade the two had set out at full speed
in pursuit of Lathrop.</p>

<p class='c009'>As his captor gripped the boy in a hold that clutched
like a vice, Lathrop realized that he had fallen into
bad hands.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c007'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br />TWO RASCALS GET A SHOCK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The boy was startled but his presence of mind did
not desert him. Lathrop, although, as has been said,
a hectoring, dictatorial sort of youth possessed plenty
of courage of a certain kind, and was no coward.
He therefore exclaimed angrily:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take your hand off me. What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same moment he gave an adroit twist, an old
football trick, and in a shake had freed himself from
the other’s detaining hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You needn’t crow quite so loudly, my young
rooster,” exclaimed the man in the tramp’s dress, “I
merely wanted to ask you a few questions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” demanded the boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What were you doing up there in the woods while
we were talking?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lathrop didn’t know whether or not the men were
armed, so that he decided that it would be folly to
tell them the facts; he therefore took refuge in
strategy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” he asked with an expression
of blank amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, come,” said the other, but there was a note of
indecision in his tones, that showed that he was not
as sure of his ground as he had been, “you
don’t mean to say that you weren’t lying hidden
while we were talking up yonder and heard every
word?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As I told you,” replied Lathrop, “I don’t know
what you are talking about. I am on my way home
through these woods and you have stopped me in
this unceremonious fashion. If there was a constable
within call I would have you arrested.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, come on, Bill,” struck in the nattily dressed
one of the pair, who had hitherto remained silent,
“the kid doesn’t know anything—that’s evident, and
we are wasting time here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not sure of that,” retorted the tramp-like
man, still unconvinced, “if I thought,” he added with
a vicious leer, “that he overheard us, I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The sentence was not completed for the reason
that at the moment a lusty voice was heard coming
up the path from the aerodrome singing at the pitch
of its lungs:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Three times round went the gallant ship;</div>
      <div class='line'>Three times round spun she,</div>
      <div class='line'>Three times round spun the gallant ship</div>
      <div class='line'>Then down to the bottom of the sea,—the sea,—the sea.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then down to the bottom of the sea.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As the singer came upon the scene in front of him
he broke off abruptly and the two men who had intercepted
Lathrop took to their heels.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hullo, there, my hearty,” cried Ben Stubbs, for he
was the vocalist, as his eyes took in the situation,
“what’s all this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>His voice held a sharp note of interrogation, for
he had immediately recognized one of the two men
who had made off as the fellow who had sneaked up
the by-street in White Plains the day before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are you?” demanded the boy suspiciously,
not certain whether in the newcomer he had a friend
or a fresh source of danger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me? oh, I’m Ben Stubbs, formerly skipper of the
tug Mary and Ann, but now one of the crew of the
<em>Golden Eagle II</em>, sky clipper. And you, my young
middy, I recognize as the chap who was down at the
aerodrome a short while ago, and got all het up because
Frank Chester wouldn’t let you see the air-ship—now
the question is what were you doing with
those two fellows, who are as bad a looking pair of
cruisers as I ever laid eyes on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lathrop saw at once that unless he told the truth
he would be a fair object of suspicion, and at any
rate he had made up his mind to warn the boys of the
danger that threatened. He therefore in a straight-forward
way told of the afternoon’s happenings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You come along with me,” exclaimed Ben, as
the boy finished his narrative, “we’ve got no time to
lose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They hurried down the path to the aerodrome
and Lathrop repeated his story to the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, forewarned is forearmed,” remarked Frank,
“and thank you, Lathrop, for doing the square
thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, that’s all right, Frank,” Lathrop replied awkwardly,
recollecting his fiery threats of a short time
before. To tell the truth, Lathrop was thoroughly
ashamed of himself, and declining the boys’ hearty
invitation to supper, hurried home to the house on the
hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had learned a lesson he never forgot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” said Frank, as soon as he had gone,
“we’ll give these fellows a surprise if they come
around here to-night that will stick in their minds for
a good many years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Under his directions everyone got busy for the rest
of the afternoon driving wooden posts at six foot intervals
all round the aerodrome. When the posts
were all in position a copper wire of medium thickness
was strung from one post top to another and the
ends connected with the dynamo ultimately destined to
supply the <em>Golden Eagle II’s</em> searchlight and wireless
equipment. By the time Ben Stubbs, who had quite
ousted Le Blanc as cook, announced by a clarion
summons, beaten on a tin wash-pan, with a big ladle,
that a supper, consisting of his famous baked beans,
chops, spinach and coffee was ready—not to forget
Ben’s masterpiece, a huge strawberry pie,—Frank
pronounced his preparations also complete.</p>

<p class='c009'>After supper everybody sat around the stove in the
portable house, for the nights were still chilly, till
about ten o’clock. They had all made as much noise
as possible early in the evening with the ultimate
motive of accentuating the quietness later on.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank and Harry stood at the door of the portable
house as Schultz and Le Blanc started for the
aerodrome and shouted out “good-night” till the
echoes rang back from the hills. Then one by one
the lights in the two houses went out and all was quiet.
That is, all seemed so to two watchers concealed in
a thick mass of brush up on the hill, but in reality
no sooner had the houses been plunged in darkness
than the boys and Ben Stubbs had crept quietly into
the aerodrome and sat down to wait for the crisis they
felt sure was coming.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry and Billy each carried a long thin package
that might have contained anything from dynamite
to a pistol. Ben Stubbs, with a grim expression on
his rugged face, grasped a stout club he had cut that
afternoon. It was pitchy dark in the aerodrome and
as they waited, in the absolute silence Frank had enjoined,
the watchers could hear one another breathing.
Upstairs only the rhythmic snores of Schultz
and Le Blanc, who were not in the secret, disturbed
the silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank sat with his hand on the switch that would
shoot a current of 500 volts through the copper
wires surrounding the aerodrome when he connected
it. A hole, bored earlier in the afternoon in the
wooden wall of the aerodrome gave the boy a command
of the view outside in the direction of the
woods. So dark was it, however, that even his keen
eyes could detect little in the black murk. He saw
they would have to judge of their enemies’ whereabouts
solely by sound.</p>

<p class='c009'>They must have sat there in the darkness for an
hour or more, with no sound being borne to their ears
but the unmelodious snoring of the two mechanics
in the loft when, suddenly, and without any further
warning there came a sharp “crack” from up
on the hillside as a branch snapped under a heavy
foot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here they come,” whispered Frank to the boys,
whom he knew were there; but couldn’t see any more
than if they were in the antipodes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get outside now, you fellows, and when I give
the word, let go!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Silently as cats Billy Barnes, Harry and Ben
Stubbs slipped off their shoes and tiptoed out through
the door of the aerodrome, which had been left open
to allow for the noiseless exit. Frank was left alone
in the barn-like aerodrome save for the two sleepers
upstairs. The tension in the silence grew painful.
When would the persons who had crackled the broken
branch on the hillside recover their courage enough
to make a further advance?</p>

<p class='c009'>All at once, close at hand, Frank heard a loud
whisper of:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, they are all asleep, evidently.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” replied another hoarse whisper, “that kid
you suspected evidently didn’t hear anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Confound it, it’s dark as a pit,” came from the
first speaker.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It might be lighter,” replied the other, “but the
blacker it is the better for us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hark at those fellows snoring,” was the next
thing Frank heard. The remark was accompanied by a
smothered laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, they are sound asleep as run-down tops,”
was the reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank inwardly blessed the stalwart lungs of
Schultz and Le Blanc. All unconsciously the sleepers
were helping on their plans.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think that’s the boys snoring?” asked one
of the two men who were cautiously creeping nearer
to the aerodrome.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope so,” was the response, “I’d like to see
them go skywards with their infernal air-ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Scudder will have reason to thank us for a
good night’s work,” was the next remark of the
prowlers.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was silence for a few seconds and then a
jangling sound. One of the men who had the destruction
of the <em>Golden Eagle II</em> at heart had collided with
Frank’s wire fence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Confound it, what’s that?” angrily hissed his
companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A wire fence,” replied the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it will take more than that to stop us,” was
the angry answer, “come on, grab the top wire and
over we go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now!” shouted Frank, as he threw in the switch
and 500 volts coursed through the copper wire both
men were grasping.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same instant Billy and Harry outside pressed
the electric buttons that ignited the Coston navy signal
lights they both carried and the whole scene was illuminated
in a white glare as light as noonday. And
what a scene it was!</p>

<p class='c009'>On the ground by the fence sprawled the
marauders yelling till the air rang with their cries of
mingled pain and amazement at the surprise of the
powerful shock that had knocked them off their feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Above them stood the stout figure of Ben Stubbs
belaboring them impartially with the heavy club he had
cut for that special purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take that, you lubbers, you longshore loafers!”
he shouted as his blows fell with the rapidity of a
drumstick on the two prostrate carcasses.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two men, however, had laid their plans better
than the boys knew. They were prepared for a surprise,
but not one of the kind they had run into.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without a second’s warning there was a sudden
flash from the hill behind them, followed by a sharp
report. Ben Stubbs threw up his hands and rolled
over with a yell more of surprise than of anything
else.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Put out those lights!” shouted Frank, realizing
that in the white glare the group outside presented
fine targets for the hidden marksman on the hill, whoever
he might be.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys instantly shoved their glaring torch tips
into the ground. Even as they did so they could
hear rapidly retreating footsteps.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t let them get away,” shouted Harry
wildly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank, who by this time had switched off the current,
and was outside, seized him with a detaining
grasp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No good, Harry,” he exclaimed. “It would be
taking needless chances. Now, let’s look to Ben.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only a hen-peck,” hailed that redoubtable ex-mariner,
coming up, “just nicked my starboard
ear, but I thought for a minute they had done
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was no fault of theirs,” answered Billy,
“they——”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was interrupted by a series of guttural shouts
and piercing shrieks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ach Himmel—donnerblitzen vass iss——!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sacre nom de nom! Qu’est-ce que cela! To
the aid. Monsieur Chest-e-erre!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The cries came from the aerodrome and were uttered
by the awakened Schultz and Le Blanc, the
latter of whom was almost in hysterics. Frank
laughingly quieted them and explained what had happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ve vos only eggcited on your aggount,” remarked
Schultz bravely when he learned that all danger was
over.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Comment, vee fight lek ze tiger-r-r n’ c’est pas?”
demanded Le Blanc, flourishing a pillow fiercely.
“A pitee I deed not see zee ras-cals.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c007'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br />THE START FOR THE ’GLADES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The incident related in the last chapter determined
Frank to abandon his half-arrived at intention to
enter the Everglades from the Atlantic side. The
appearance of the dark man in Washington—he was
now certain their plans had been overheard—the
episode of the tramp and the attempt to blow up the
aerodrome all combined to convince him that his original
scheme of invasion of the little known wastes
of Southern Florida was as an open book to the men
who had only too evidently their destruction at heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>A hasty trip to Washington resulted, and a consultation
with the Secretary of the Navy. The result
was that arrangements were made whereby the boys’
expedition was to gather at Miami as openly as possible,
and then under cover of night run down Biscayne
Bay and eventually double Cape Sable by the inland
passage. Then they were to beat up through the
Ten Thousand Island Archipelago to the mouth of
either Shark or Harney River and thence into the
trackless wastes of unmapped swamp and saw-grass
known as the Everglades.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <em>Tarantula</em> was to cruise off and on around the
coast and in case of dire need was to be signaled by
wireless. These details completed, Frank and Harry
returned to New York and a week later, the <em>Golden
Eagle II</em> being completed, and loaded in small cases
marked “Glass, Fragile,” and other misleading labels,
the Boy Aviators bade farewell to their mother and
friends and started by the Southern Limited for
Miami. With them they carried in ordinary trunks
their mess and camp kit outfits, rifles and medical
supplies as well as two of the Government’s field
wireless outfits. The rest of the party was to follow
a week later in a private car with all the other baggage,
including the boxed sections of the <em>Golden
Eagle II</em>. The canoes and boats for the trips were to
be purchased at Miami or along the coast in the vicinity,
as the boys deemed fit. In the meantime the <em>Tarantula</em>
had been dispatched from Hampton Roads for
Southern waters under sealed orders. Not till her
commander opened his instructions at sea did he know
the real nature of his errand.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this point it may not be amiss to give a brief
description of the little known country to which the
boys were bound. Everyone has heard of the Everglades,
few have any accurate idea of them beyond a
sort of hazy conception of a vast tract of morass,
overgrown with giant forests and rank growth of all
kinds. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is without doubt the peculiar, even extraordinary,
character of this great stretch of country that has
caused its geography to remain obscure. Even recent
maps are extremely inaccurate. It seems remarkable
in these days of African and Polar discovery that here
in our own country is a vast waste, 130 miles long and
70 wide, that is as little known to the white man as the
heart of the Sahara. The Everglades are bounded on
the north by Lake Okeechobee, on the east by a belt
of scrub pine-land about six miles wide facing the
Atlantic, on the south by the great mangrove swamps
facing the Bay of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico,
and on the west by the Big Cypress Swamp which
runs right up to the uninhabited region verging on
the west coast of the peninsula.</p>

<p class='c009'>The prevailing idea that the Everglades are unhealthy
is about as far as it is possible to get from
the truth. So far as the few expeditions that have
penetrated the great mystery have reported, the water
is fine and the air healthful. The saw-grass, the Seminoles
and the snakes—rattlers and cotton-mouth
moccasins—are the worst enemies the explorer ordinarily
encounters, with an occasional panther.</p>

<p class='c009'>Over the watery wastes of the Everglades which
are not tree grown, but on the contrary great expanses
of saw-grass grown prairie, the Seminole poles his
cypress dug-out defying the government which wishes
to place him on a reservation but has no means of
“smoking him out” of the impassable wilds he has
chosen for his refuge. The Seminoles also haunt the
Big Cypress Swamp and observe numerous tribal rites
and legends of which we know little. They are dignified,
trustworthy people—but the bad treatment
they have received from the government has made
them the implacable foe of the white man for whom
their word is the same as “liar”—such has been their
impression of civilization.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys had familiarized themselves with the
nature of the country by a close study of all the available
works on the subject—which were not many.
The government had placed the latest maps and charts
of the region at their disposal. Even these, however,
showed them little. In fact the parting words of the
Secretary of the Navy to them were:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boys, you’ll have to blaze your own trail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course in selecting an equipment for such a
region the boys had made lightness the prime essential.</p>

<p class='c009'>They knew that on much of the journey in search
for a spot for a permanent camp they would have to
pole over shoal water, in some places not more than
two feet deep. An overloaded canoe might therefore
cause a lot of trouble and delay. Like true old
campaigners they had prepared elaborate lists and
then gone through them again and again till nothing
appeared on them but the barest necessities.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ben Stubbs had put in several days making a number
of light but strong chests twenty-two inches by
thirteen and nine inches deep. These contained,
among other necessities, an aluminum cooking outfit
weighing nine pounds. There were two pots, a frying
pan and four plates nesting into each other. And
then there was a coffee pot in which was stowed away
four cups (nested) pepper and salt castors, knives,
spoons and forks, the frying-pan and coffee-pot had
detachable handles for lifting on and off the campfire
with ease and comfort, no matter how the wind
might be blowing the flames about.</p>

<p class='c009'>The grocery chest contained flour, sugar, salt,
cornmeal, pepper, sliced bacon, beef extracts, soup-tablets
(three varieties), root-beer, lemonade and sarsaparilla
tablets, oatmeal and evaporated fruits of
various kinds. These were all put in glass jars with
screw tops and rubber gaskets so that even in case
of an upset the contents would remain dry. There
was also a blue-flame double burner kerosene stove
of the marine type, lanterns, and a supply of candles
and matches in waterproof jars. The medical outfit
consisted of some antiseptics, pills, several tablets of
permanganate of potassium for the same purpose
and a hypodermic outfit, bandages and lotions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Each boy carried an automatic rifle for big game
or defense, the kind chosen being a weapon
carrying .49-50 nickeled steel cartridges. This gun was heavy
enough for alligators; or the more savage crocodile,
pumas, leopards, gray wolves or any human enemy.
They also purchased two three-barreled guns having
two parallel barrels, twelve gauge, for shotted shells,
and another rifled barrel underneath of .35-55 caliber.
Two 16-gauge shot-guns for duck and small game
were also stowed away in the “armory” chest. In
addition each boy had his magazine revolver of .38
caliber, and a six-inch bladed hunting-knife with a
heavy back so that it might even be used for chopping.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shovels, axes, picks, etc., were back with the heavy
baggage to be brought on by Ben Stubbs and Billy.
Frank, of course, carried his nautical instruments.
A sextant, a compass, two tested watches of the finest
split-second make and an artificial horizon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their clothes were stout hunting boots, khaki
trousers and Norfolk jackets of the same material and
flannel shirts with campaign hats. Each carried a
change of underwear and socks in his toilet bag which
also held two towels, toothbrush, cake of soap and
brush and comb.</p>

<p class='c009'>For transportation into the Everglades the boys
soon managed with little difficulty to secure canoes
and a lighter draught “cruiser,” similar to a Barnegat
duck-boat. The flotilla was to be taken down the
coast by an auxiliary sloop also chartered at Miami.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the appointed day the boys were at the railroad
station of the Florida East Coast railroad to meet the
arrivals from New York, and warm were the greetings
as Billy Barnes and Stubbs stepped from the
private car which had been attached for them when
they left the north. The car was sidetracked at Miami
and the train kept on its way to Key West along the
wonderful chain of cement bridges constructed over
the numberless keys that run out from the “leg” of
Florida. The boys and Ben were busily engaged
getting the various bales and crates in some sort of
order for transfer to the trucks by which they were
to be taken to the flotilla of canoes when they were
startled at being hailed by a voice that sounded
familiar.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys hastened to the door of one end of the
car and were amazed to see standing on the steps,
looking rather embarrassed and doubtful, Lathrop
Beasley. He wore a well cut suit of white serge and
a straw hat with a light blue ribbon. In addition he
sported snowy canvas shoes, topped off with light
purple socks and a pale pink tie. Altogether he
looked as if he had just stepped from a clothing ad.
Even in their astonishment at seeing him there the
boys could not help laughing at the contrast they
presented to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>In their rough working garb, and all begrimed with
dust as they were from handling the kit in the car,
two more unpresentable youths from a sartorial standpoint,
could not well be imagined. The three boys
gazed at each other in silence for a few seconds and
then Lathrop said rather shamefacedly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello, fellows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Lathrop, what on earth are you doing
here?” naturally demanded Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess I came on a wild impulse,” began Lathrop,
and then stopped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?” questioned Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When I heard of your trip, from hanging around
the aerodrome after you left—oh, it wasn’t Ben
Stubbs or Barnes that told me, they were close as
clams,”—he hurried on, “but when old Schultz told
me that you were going to cross the Everglades I
thought that maybe you’d need an extra hand so I got
permission from my folks and here I am.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you want to say the word I’ll go back,” he
concluded rather lamely but with a longing look in
his face that told of his eager desire to be allowed to
join the expedition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you certainly have an impetuous way of
doing things,” commented Frank. “Did you come
on this train?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” replied the boy. “I’ve just been up to the
hotel and engaged rooms and tidied up a bit and then
hurried right down here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank and Harry exchanged glances of amusement,
the cause of which Lathrop was at a loss to
fathom.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” began Frank, after a brief whispered conversation
with his brother, “you are here now and I
suppose you’ll have to stay. We can find some work
I dare say for you to do and there are a lot of ways
you can be useful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll start right in at anything you tell me,” began
the boy eagerly. “It’s mighty good of you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much you won’t. Not in that fancy rig,”
burst out Harry, “if you are coming with us you’d
better go up to the village store and get an outfit as
much like ours as possible and forget you ever patronized
a tailor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lathrop gladly agreed and hurried off to get himself
a working outfit. As he hastened down the
tracks, Frank turned to Harry with a grin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we have gone and done it now,” he said.
“But we really have use for another hand, and I
think that we can make something out of Lathrop,
besides we owe him a debt of gratitude for helping us
out at White Plains. If it hadn’t been for him we
might have lost the <em>Golden Eagle II</em> and all our
work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s so,” assented Harry. “I guess he will
work out all right. But those fancy duds he had
on——”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the boy burst out laughing at the recollection.</p>

<p class='c009'>By sundown most of the “duffle” in the car had
been transferred to trucks and carted down to the
wharf, where the boys, with considerable pride, exhibited
to Ben Stubbs, Billy, and the newly overalled
Lathrop, the light draught thirty-foot sloop, with an
auxiliary five-horse engine, the four canoes and the
light draught “sneak-box,” they had secured for their
transportation round the Cape and into the Thousand
Island Archipelago. The canoes were of the “Ontario”
type, fitted with narrow decks round the edges
and canvas covered. The sneak-box was of the spoon-bowed
variety familiar to duckers in Barnegat Bay.
It drew only a few inches of water and afforded a lot
of space in its sixteen feet of length for the stowage
of the heavier baggage. It rejoiced in the name of
<em>Squeegee</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ben Stubbs was delighted with the “fleet” as he
called it, and declared that the sloop was a “witch.”
After a dinner at the quiet boarding house at which
the boys had been stopping the adventurers that night
finished the stowage of their impedimenta aboard the
sloop and piled the canoes on the top of the canvas
enclosed “summer cabin.” The “sneak-box” was
towed astern.</p>

<p class='c009'>The owner of the sloop, a coal-black negro called
Pork Chops—the boys could never discover that he
had any other name—was to take them round the
cape as far as the Thousand Island Archipelago where
they were to be left. From there on their course
would lie up the Shark River into the heart of the
little known Everglades.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course the wharf loungers were full of curiosity
as the work of transferring the boys’ belongings and
outfit to the sloop proceeded, but Frank and Harry
had allowed it to become widely circulated that they
were a hunting party bound for some of the keys to
the east of Cape Sable, and “Pork Chops” also was
of this belief, so that the boys were pretty sure that
none but the members of their own immediate party
knew of the real goal of their journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>By midnight everything was in readiness and the
tide served for start. With her big mainsail flapping
lazily in the breath of wind that was stirring Pork
Chops’ sloop, which held the poetic name of <em>Carrier
Dove</em> dropped down Biscayne Bay with her “kicker”
going and dawn found her well on her journey south
with a spanking breeze out of the northeast to fill her
canvas. As she skimmed along over the sparkling
blue of the tropical waters in whose crystalline depths
hosts of fish of all kinds could be easily seen and on
the surface of which floated great masses of yellow
gulf weed, the boys rejoiced that their momentous
expedition had started so auspiciously. As for Lathrop
he acted like a boy out of his head with joy at
his unexpected good fortune. Ben Stubbs and the
inky Pork Chops relieved each other at the wheel, and
Frank and Harry, at the table in the stuffy little cabin,
worked at plans and lists trying to devise ways of
still further cutting down their outfit without impairing
its usefulness. Billy Barnes, with a knowing air,
scrutinized the sails and from time to time admonished
Ben Stubbs to “keep her up a bit,” to which suggestion
Ben with an air of ineffable contempt
replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never knowed they taught navigation on a newspaper
but it’s a good school for nerve.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c007'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br />A NIGHT ATTACK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Most of that day they dropped leisurely down
Hawk Channel and at night anchored off a small key
covered with a luxuriant tropical growth and topped
by the feathery crowns of a group of stately royal
palms. It was early afternoon when they let go the
anchor and the boys lost no time in getting into the
Squeegee and rowing ashore. They carried with
them the <em>Carrier Dove’s</em> water keg which held ten gallons
and which had been discovered by them to be
half empty the first time they went forward for a
drink. What water there was in it was so stale as to
be almost undrinkable. Pork Chops was summarily
sent for and arraigned on the “quarter deck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I done declar I clean forgit all about deh watah,”
he gasped, as Frank read him a lecture on his carelessness.
Indeed everything about the <em>Carrier Dove</em>
bore witness to Pork Chops’ shiftless ways. Her
rigging was spliced in innumerable places and her halyards
badly frayed so that they wedged in the blocks
sometimes. Her paint was peeled off her sides in
large flakes and altogether she was quite as disreputable
a proposition as her owner; but in her, Pork
Chops had navigated the waters about Miami for many
years and was accounted a skilful mariner.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys uttered a cry of delight as the Squeegee’s
nose grated on a beach of white sand and they sprang
out. The key was a veritable fairyland. Lime, lemon
and guava trees grew almost down to the water’s edge
and further back were several wild banana plants
with their yellow fruit hanging temptingly for the
boys to pluck. And pluck it they did and declared
they had never known what real bananas were like
before,—which is hardly surprising as the fruit is
picked for the northern market long before it is ripe
and shipped in a green state.</p>

<p class='c009'>After they had fairly gorged themselves on fruit,
they set out to look for a spring. They were not long
in finding it and Billy Barnes, dipper in hand, started
in to fill the keg. He had ladled out a few dipperfuls
when he started back with a yell. The others,
who had been roaming about in the vicinity, hurried
back and found the reporter gazing petrified at a
huge cotton mouth moccassin. Frank, who had one
of the sixteen gauge guns with him, quickly despatched
the creature, which was about three feet
long.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ugh, what a monster,” exclaimed Lathrop, as he
gazed at the ugly, dirty-brown colored body.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is a pretty sizeable reptile and that’s a fact,”
remarked Frank, “But what would you say to a
serpent twenty feet long?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The others looked at him incredulously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Twenty feet long—Oh come, Frank,” laughed
Billy. “That sounds like the fish that got away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lieutenant Willoughby, who explored the Everglades
in 1897, reports that he heard from Indians
and believed himself that in the southern portions of
the Everglades there are snakes bigger than any known
species,” replied Frank, “his guide killed a reptile
marked with longitudinal stripes,—but otherwise like
a rattlesnake,—which measured nine feet from tip to
tip.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I don’t want to be around when any such
creatures as that are about,” said Lathrop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m with you there,” cried Billy, “snake stories
are all right in print but I don’t want to figure in any
of them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, boys,—volunteers to get supper,” cried
Frank, after the group had strolled back to the boat
landing,—all hands taking turn at packing the water
keg.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Supper?” cried the others.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” replied Frank, “we can row the keg off
to the <em>Carrier Dove</em>, get some duffle ashore and camp
here in the jungle for a night. There’s no use trying
to navigate this coast in the dark. Who says—yes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course they all did,—hailing his suggestion with
acclamation,—and, after Frank and Harry had rowed
off to the sloop, Lathrop and Billy Barnes set about
getting in a supply of firewood and laying a fire between
two green logs set parallel, in a manner that
did credit to Bill’s training as a woodsman in Nicaragua.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank and Harry were too tender-hearted to resist
Ben Stubbs’ pleadings to be made one of the party—moreover
he promised to cook them what he called a
bush supper if allowed to come ashore, so that when
the boys shoved off in the placid water on their return
trip to the Island Ben made one of the Squeegee’s load.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as they got ashore Ben approvingly commended
Billy’s camp-fire arrangements, at which the
reporter glowed with pleasure. Somehow in the
wilderness a small tribute to a boy’s handiness will
send him into the seventh heaven of gratified pride.
Under Ben Stubbs’ orders the party had soon secured
several bunches of oysters from the mangroves,—which
were laden with the bivalves where they dipped
into the water at low tide,—as well as half a dozen
turtles, small fellows which Ben declared made as
good eating as the terrapin of the northern restaurant
and banquet. To crown the feast, Frank, who had
been scouting about with one of the shot-guns, brought
down a couple of small ducks.</p>

<p class='c009'>The oysters Ben roasted in their shells, laying them
when finished on plantain leaves on previously heated
rocks. The turtles he prepared by scalding them and
then, after cutting down the center of the lower shell,
the meat was easily got at. Salted and peppered inside
and out and the meat removed from the shell
after a half-an-hour’s boiling with onions and the
young campers had a meal fit for a president, who, as
Billy observed, “is a heap more particular than a
king.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The ducks were incased by Ben in a sort of matrix
of clay—feathers and all,—having first been cleaned.
Thus enclosed they were placed in the glowing embers
and more hot coals raked over on top of them.
When in half an hour Ben drew out the hard-baked
clay casings and cracked them free with a hatchet,—which
automatically skinned the birds and plucked
them at the same time,—the boys were ready to acclaim
him a very prince of chefs. The meal was eaten
with pilot bread and washed down with lemonade
made from spring water and lemonade tablets. For
dessert they had bananas and wild oranges. Many
times after that when they were plunged in hardships
and difficulties the boys talked over that first meal on
the lone Florida Key.</p>

<p class='c009'>After supper there was no washing up to do; big
plantain leaves having served as plates and hunting-knives
as table utensils. The little party sat round the
big camp-fire and sang songs and talked and laughed
till Pork Chops out on the <em>Carrier Dove</em> muttered to
himself as he tried to sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dem white boys done bein’ as clean crazy as
loons,—yas, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>However, at last even the boys’ spirits began to
flag and they tucked themselves up in their blankets
and lulled by the croaking and snoring of a big tree
lizard in a near-by custard apple-tree, sank into dreams
which were more or less tinctured by the happenings
of the last few days.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank, more wakeful than the others, lay awake
perhaps half an hour after Ben Stubbs’ nasal performances
had begun to rival those of the tree-lizard;
who was himself no mean performer. The boy-leader’s
brain was busy turning over their momentous
expedition. In a few days now they would be in the
Archipelago and the plunge into the unknown would
have to be taken. As he gazed about him at the sleeping party—Harry
and Billy, light and careless, Lathrop,
apparently made of far better metal than Frank
had believed, and at old grizzled Ben Stubbs sleeping,
like most woodsmen, as soundly as an infant, he felt a
sensation of heavy responsibility steal over him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Was the expedition well advised? It might all end
in nothing or even in disaster. These thoughts flitted
through Frank’s brain as he lay awake and pondered
the situation. Of one thing he was determined, as
soon as the wireless could be put in operation and a
permanent camp established in the ’glades he would
establish communication with the <em>Tarantula</em>. That at
least would put them in touch with powerful allies
whatever foes and evil influences they might encounter
in the great fastnesses they were about to penetrate.
Satisfied with this last resolve Frank fell asleep; but
his was a troubled slumber. It seemed to him but a
few minutes after he had dropped off that he awakened
with a start:</p>

<p class='c009'>The fire had died low and there was only a dull red
glow to indicate where its cheerful blaze had been.
As his eyes opened, however, Frank had a queer sensation
that his awakening had been directly caused by
some outside action that had affected him. In a second
he sensed what it was.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a hand poking about under his pillow
where he had tucked his revolver!</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same instant there came a loud agonized
hail from over the moonlit water where the <em>Carrier
Dove</em> swung at anchor.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Pork Chops’ voice, and Frank sprang to his
feet as he heard it, reckless of injury from the unseen
intruder. He need not have been under any apprehension,
however, for whoever the prowler was he
had vanished. At the same moment Pork Chops’ yells
awakened the others and Ben Stubbs roared out with
stentorian lungs:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahoy, there aboard the sloop—What’s up?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For reply came a wail from Pork Chops, which was
stifled as suddenly as if a hand had been placed on his
throat:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Help! murder! Dey’s——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then all was silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Like a flash the boys and Ben piled into the Squeegee
and Ben manned the oars. As they fairly flew over
the water under his powerful strokes a long, low dark
body,—almost reptilian in its swift movement,—glided
from the opposite side of the <em>Carrier Dove</em>. At the
same instant the sharp staccato sound of an engine
exhaust came to the boys’ ears and a strong odor of
gasolene.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A motor-boat,” shouted Frank, as the low body,
gathering speed momentarily, tore off across the moonlit
water and vanished in the dark shadows off the end
of the island.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br />THE MEN OF THE ISLAND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Once on board the <em>Carrier Dove</em> the mystery was
deepened. There was not a trace of Pork Chops,
though his blankets lay apparently just as they had
been thrown aside when he leaped up at the invasion
of the motor-boat intruders. Frank lit a lantern and
naturally the first thing the boys hastened to investigate
was whether any harm had come to the cases
containing the frame of <em>The Golden Eagle II</em>. To
their unspeakable relief everything was intact, nor did
any of the boxes show traces of having been tampered
with.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The whole thing seems inexplicable,” mused
Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all,” replied Frank, “I suppose that they
figured we were asleep ashore and sneaked up in their
motor-boat to rifle our possessions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but why did they carry off Pork Chops?”
protested Billy; “for unless they threw him
overboard, they must have taken him,—unless he’s been
carried off by mosquitoes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They would naturally have carried him off as I
figure it,” rejoined Frank, “not wishing to have him
meet us and describe the appearance of our visitors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That sounds good horse sense,” put in Ben
Stubbs. “And in my opinion them chaps in the motor-boat
was the same limpets as stuck around the aerodrome
in White Plains,” he continued sagely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think there’s much doubt of that, Ben,”
replied Frank, “the thing is how did they get here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, the rate we’ve been coming it would have
been mighty easy for them in a light draught motor-boat
to have kept track of us from near inshore if
they had a good glass,” rejoined Ben.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But how did they trace us to Miami?” puzzled
Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Easy enough,” replied Billy, “I’ve done it dozens
of times—traced people I mean. I guess they just
looked up the baggage man and found where our stuff
was checked to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I ought to have guessed that,” exclaimed
Frank. “It’s really too mortifying,” he concluded in
a vexed tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Consarn ’em,” muttered Ben, embracing his rifle
longingly, “I’d like to get ’em quartered off this sight.
I’d drop a precious bad pair of birds in a couple of
shots.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No use thinking of that now,” rejoined Frank,
briskly shaking off his annoyance over what couldn’t
be helped, “the thing to do at present is to finish
our night’s sleep and set a watch. We don’t want
those fellows coming back and blowing the boat
up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was agreed that Ben Stubbs was to sit up and
take the watch, and that hardy veteran himself had no
small share in influencing the verdict. He felt that
he as the oldest of the party and the more experienced
should have the responsibility in case real trouble was
to come. The boys were not long, even after the exciting
interruption to their slumbers, in sinking to sleep
again on the transoms in the summer cabin of the
<em>Carrier Dove</em>. As for Ben he sat up on the after deck
with his rifle between his knees till the moon went
down and the stars began to wane. And all the time
he never took his eyes off the shore where the dying
camp-fire still spread a reddish glow against the blackness
of the thick jungle tangle.</p>

<p class='c009'>He might have been watching an hour when he gave
a sudden start.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well that’s queer too,” he remarked to himself,
as he fixed his eyes with stern intensity on the little
glow of light thrown out by the embers. A dark
figure had cautiously crossed the illumination, standing
silhouetted for a moment against it. Suddenly a
loud “hoo-hoo” like the hoot of an owl sounded from
the shore. The same moment in the old adventurer’s
reckless heart was borne a resolve which bore fruit
when at dawn, as the rim of a glorious sun poked
itself over the sparkling blue expanse of waters, and
showed them vacant, he drew in the Squeegee’s
painter and slipped lightly into her. He sculled ashore
and approaching the camp crouched almost on his
hands and knees. He examined the ground closely
for a few minutes, as if in keen search of something.
After a few minutes of this concentrated scrutiny he
suddenly straightened up and strode off unhesitatingly
into the jungle. But as he parted the creepers before
him he gripped his rifle in the crotch of his arm with
his finger on the trigger. He was not going to be
taken by surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>The green mystery of the forest had not long closed
on Ben’s stalwart form when the boys awoke as the
sunlight streamed through the canvas-curtains of the
<em>Carrier’s Dove’s</em> “main saloon”. Rubbing their eyes
sleepily they hastened out on deck. For a few seconds
the glory of the tropic dawn engrossed their attention
to the exclusion of all else. Then with a cry of alarm
Lathrop shouted:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Squeegee’s gone!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gone?” echoed the others.</p>

<p class='c009'>For answer Lathrop pointed to the stern. It was
true, no Squeegee swung there at her painter. It was
only a fraction of time before the absence of Ben
Stubbs was also discovered. For a minute a dark
thought crossed Frank’s mind,—but he dismissed it
as unworthy, and was glad he did, for suddenly Billy
shouted:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, there’s the Squeegee ashore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They all looked and there, sure enough, lay their
sneak-box where Ben, a short time before, had deserted
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He must have gone ashore hunting,” cried Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He had some graver reason than that for going,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, let’s swim ashore and find out what has become
of him,” cried Lathrop, and indeed the turquoise
water into whose depths one could see, did
look tempting enough for an early morning plunge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would be our last swim, Lathrop,” remarked
Frank, pointing as he spoke to a wicked-looking triangular
black fin that cruised by.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See that leg o’ mutton?” he continued, “well,
that’s hitched onto the back of a man-eating shark and
they don’t encourage early morning bathing except
for their larder’s benefit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he spoke the monster glided close to the side of
the <em>Carrier Dove</em>, perhaps in search of ship scraps, for
which sharks will sometimes follow ships for days to
satisfy their insatiable appetites. With an ill-concealed
shudder Lathrop watched the great shadowy
body flit by the sloop’s side, with a wicked little pig-like
eye cocked knowingly up, as much as to say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Any breakfast ready yet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I like those fellows less than the snakes,” exclaimed
Lathrop.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the laugh at his expense had subsided Frank
suggested that they get into canoes at once and go
ashore to discover what had become of Ben. The
proposal was greeted as a good one and in short time the
light craft were overboard and the boys paddling with
all their might for the shore. Lathrop kept his eyes
steadily ahead all the way, nor did he once look at the
transparent water about them which, as the sun got
higher, began to swarm with black fins and queer ill-shaped
monsters of the deep,—jew-fish, rays, and
huge sun-fish,—which seen through the water looked
like so many ill-shaped dragons. On shore the boys
hastened at once to their camp-fire of the night before.
Its ashes were strewn abroad but in the gray
dust, Frank, with an exclamation of surprise, made
out the numerous indentations of a queer-shaped flat
foot—it was the same mark that had made Ben set
off through the jungle. But the boys, less expert
than he, could not track their way by looking out for
bent ferns or broken bits of undergrowth.</p>

<p class='c009'>A council of war was held. There were some of
the leavings of the feast of the night before in the
cooking-pots, and on these and some coffee brought
ashore in the small emergency box fitted into each
canoe, they made a satisfactory breakfast, after which,
as the result of their confab, it was decided to attempt
to circumnavigate the island in the canoes. By this
means they thought they were pretty sure of finding
Ben as the fact that the spot of land being unchartered
argued against its being of any considerable size.</p>

<p class='c009'>In fifteen minutes the canoes were underway and
rapidly skirting the island. On the smooth water they
made swift progress and in little more than an hour
had rounded the southerly point and were working
their way up the other coast. The island had turned
out to be even smaller than they thought. They were
opposite a pretty little bay in which, instead of the
everlasting mangroves, an inviting little strip of pure
white sand, fringed by a green palm grove, sloped
down to the water, when suddenly their ears were
saluted by a shot from the woods.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ben Stubbs!” was their simultaneous thought
and the canoes were at once headed for the shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having landed, the boys with loud shouts of “Ahoy,
Ben!” dashed up through the woods which, to their
astonishment, were threaded at this point by a path—a
crude track certainly, but still a path. They did not
give much time to the consideration of their surroundings
however, their minds being bent on finding Ben.
Suddenly out of the brush right ahead there sounded
the “hoo-hoo” of an owl. Now even Lathrop was
enough of a naturalist to know that owls do not hoot
in the broad daylight, so they all stopped and exchanged
wondering glances.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, that’s a new one,” remarked Billy sententiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who ever heard of an owl that knocked about in
the sunlight before?” added Lathrop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Even in this enchanted land,” concluded Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank put all further speculation to rout by exclaiming,
as the hoot was repeated from a further recess
of the forest, and yet again in the still further
distance:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is not an owl’s hoot, boys. It’s a signal given
by some human being.”</p>

<p class='c009'>No wonder the boys looked startled. After the adventure
of the previous night they had good reason to
distrust any human being they might encounter on the
island. Whoever the inhabitants were they certainly
had no good will toward the young adventurers, so
much at least was patently evident.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, come on, boys,” cried Frank at last,
“There’s no use stopping here,” he added, as the
“hoo-hoo” sounded uncannily from right behind
them, “our escape to the boats is cut off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With grave looks they followed their young leader
down the blind trail that led to they knew not what.
Suddenly, and without an instant’s warning, a number
of wild-looking, unkempt men and youths sprang
out of the dense growth as if they had sprouted from
the earth. They all carried ancient Winchesters and
one or two even had an old-fashioned flint-lock.
Their clothes were ragged to a degree. As ragged in
fact as their hair and beards. With their thin, peaked
noses, sunken cheeks, and wild, hawk-like eyes they
were sinister looking specimens.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What d’ye want y’ar, strangers?” demanded one
in a high nasal voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We came ashore on a hunting trip,” rejoined
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this all the crackers set up a loud roar of laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ’uns are hunting big game, we reckon,” remarked
a gangling youth in tattered blue homespun.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was an angry murmur. Things looked just
about as bad as they could when suddenly an unexpected
diversion occurred. A wild-looking young
woman, whose movements, despite her miserable rags,
were as graceful as those of a wild fawn, dashed
through the jungle and appeared in the middle of the
group which hemmed the boys in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Josh, you’re a fool. Jed, you’re another, and you
too, Amelech, and Will. Why for don’t you alls bring
they ’uns into camp?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The men all looked sheepish.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yer see—,” began one.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl stamped her foot impatiently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You alls ain’t none of yer got no more sense than
so many loons,” she cried angrily. “Don’t you ’uns
see that they ’uns is Black Bart’s friends?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The men looked incredulous, but nevertheless their
attitude changed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, bein’ that’s the case, come ahead, strangers,”
said the tall man who had first spoken and, with their
wild escort clustering about them, the wondering boys
followed him down the dim trail.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of who Black Bart might be or where they were
going they had not the slightest idea, but that Black
Bart’s influence was so far favorable to them there
seemed no reason to doubt.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c007'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br />A MESSAGE FROM THE UNKNOWN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After a few minutes’ travel they emerged without
warning into a spherical clearing, perhaps sixty feet
in circumference. All about it stood palmetto-thatched
huts in which crouched timid-looking women and
children. The place was enclosed by a solid wall of
trees and closely growing vines. Great gray beards
of Spanish moss waved from the trees above them.
It was a spot that would have been impossible to find
unless one had the key to the forest labyrinth. It was
evidently the men’s home.</p>

<p class='c009'>In one portion of the clearing was a singular apparatus
that attracted the attention of the boys at once,
puzzled though they were over their position, and
whether they were in the hands of friends or enemies.
This object was a huge iron kettle that was placed
over a blazing fire of fat pine-knots. This fire was
being fed by a youth who might have been the brother
of one of the men who stopped them in the forest. A
cover, evidently fashioned from some kind of wood,
covered the iron pot and from this lid a pipe of
metal led to a crude trough. From the end of the
pipe was constantly dripping a colorless liquid which
was carefully gathered into a small tin by the man
stationed at the trough, and from time to time, he and
others in the clearing took a sip from the tin. Overcome
by curiosity Harry asked a lanky youth,
who slouched by just then, what the affair might
be.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t ask no questions, stranger, and you won’t
git told no lies,” was the impudent reply that made
Harry hanker—as he whispered to Billy—to “land
the perambulating clothes-horse one on the jaw.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the mystery was soon to be cleared up and in
a surprising way. While the boys were still wondering
what sort of a place and into what sort of company
they could have fallen, a figure came striding
toward them that they at once recognized with a thrill
of delight at seeing a familiar face.</p>

<p class='c009'>The newcomer was Ben Stubbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked rather sheepish as the boys hailed him
with loud shouts of delight and seemed embarrassed
when Frank asked him what he was doing in this
queer settlement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, boys,” he said at length, “I declar’ to goodness
I don’ know but what you’ll think I’m a piratical
sort of craft, but—but the fact is that these folks
around this yere camp are old shipmates of mine in a
manner of speaking, an’ so you needn’t be a bit
afeard. Yer as safe as if you were in your own
bunks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As may be imagined this did not at all clear up the
clouds of mystery that Ben Stubbs’ sudden appearance
had aroused in the boys’ minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but who are these people?” demanded
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you get here?” chimed in Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And who may Black Bart be?” was Billy’s contribution.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what is that funny pot with a pipe on the
top of it over there?” concluded Lathrop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One at a time, mates,—one at a time or you’ll
swamp me,” cried Ben, getting back a little of his
easy-going manner; “wail, now, first of all, I am
Black Bart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?” was the amazed chorus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure,” was the reply, “but I’ve reformed now,
shipmates, so don’t be afeard; but the boys here still
call me by the old name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, go on, Black Bart,” said Frank, smiling
at the idea of good-natured Ben’s ever having owned
such a ferocious name.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall,” drawled Ben, “I got here in the Squeegee
after I had seen from the <em>Carrier Dove</em> a man snooping
around our fire and heard the old ‘Hoo-hoo’ cry—the
owl hail, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We heard it in the jungle before we were surrounded,”
said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That gave me a queer idea—the hearing of the
old cry did”—went on Ben—“that there might be
some of my friends hereabout. I had reason to
know they were in this part of the country, for after
they were driven out of Tennessee by the government
a lot of them came down here into the
’glades.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Driven out by the government?” echoed Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure,” was the easy reply, “and now to answer
your last question—that thing my young shipmate
Lathrop calls a ‘funny pot’ is a whisky still and
these folks you see around us are moonshiners.
There’s a price on the head of most every one of
them,” concluded Ben.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys looked their questions. Their amazement
prevented them speaking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” continued Ben in a low voice, “most of the
older ones has dropped a ‘revenue’ at one time or another.
Poor devils, if you’d ever seen the way they
were hounded you maybe wouldn’t blame ’em so
much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were you ever a moonshiner, Ben?” asked
Lathrop in an awed tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ben winked with a wink that spoke volumes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say a friend of the moonshiners, younker, and
you’ll be near it,” he replied. “I used to keep a kind
of traveling store to help the boys out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>From which the boys gathered that at one period
of his adventurous career the versatile Ben had been a
“runner” of moonshine whisky—as the man is called
who, at great risks, carries the poisonous stuff into the
outer world from the secret mountain stills where it is
made. The coincidence of Ben meeting his old friends
on the island was after all not so remarkable as it
seemed. Since the government has run most of the
moonshiners out of the Tennessee and North Carolina
mountains hundreds of them have taken refuge in the
keys and among the ’glades where their product finds
a ready market among the Seminoles—who gladly
destroy themselves with “whyome” as they call the
product of the illicit stills.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys soon found out that it was one of the
moonshiners who had tried to get Frank’s revolver
from under his pillow while he slept—not with intent
to do him any harm but because the sight of the
weapon earlier in the evening while they had been
singing round the camp-fire—watched as it now appeared
by a hundred keen eyes—had excited his desire
to own it. The mystery of the motor-boat that kidnapped
poor Pork Chops, however, was in no wise
cleared up, and as the boys and Ben sat down to a
meal of yellow corn pone, broiled wild hog, pompano,
fried plantain and a sort of orange preserve,
to which they did ample justice, the subject occupied
most of their thoughts and conversation. As they ate
the moonshiners shyly watched them with their wild,
hunted eyes. They refused to sit down to eat with the
party of adventurers, but flitted about evidencing
much interest at the boys’ table manners and their
plain embarrassment at having no other table utensils
but their fingers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The meal concluded, Ben lit his pipe and gave himself
up to after-dinner contemplation. The boys
wandered about the camp unchecked. The moonshiners
seemed even disposed to be friendly, in an
offish sort of way, after Ben’s endorsement of the
boys. One of them approached them with a pannikin
full of the colorless stuff from the still. He explained
that they distilled it from fields of cane they had in another
part of the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>The very smell of the stuff sickened the boys, who
waved it away as politely as they could. Their refusal
did not ruffle the moonshiner, who drained the pannikin
off himself with evident relish although the portion
he had poured out had been intended to suffice
the entire quartette of boys. “Black Bart,” too, had
a little fallen off in the estimation of the moonshiners
because he also refused to touch their product. They
shook their heads over his negative reply to an invitation
to drink as men who regret the downfall of
a once upright man.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the boys were wandering about the camp
their attention was attracted to a bottle suspended to
a pole outside the hut of one of the moonshiners. It
was swathed in ribbons and bits of bright tin and
seemed to be regarded as some sort of a costly ornament.
This was partly explained by the fact that
the wife of the owner of the hut was an Indian woman
and was the person who had ornamented the bottle
for “big medicine.” But a closer scrutiny revealed
to the boys a rolled piece of paper inside it on which
there was some faint writing. As it seemed to be in
English their curiosity was therefore considerably
aroused.</p>

<p class='c009'>They questioned the woman closely about it. At
first they could get no satisfactory replies. At length,
however, after Frank had given her a bright silver
dollar—she refused a paper one—the squaw became
more talkative.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Um-him come from o-tee (islands) long time go.”
She pointed to the westward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The islands round Cape Sable?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>She seemed to understand, for she nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My man find him—he float,” she grunted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boys, this bottle was found afloat. This may be
a message from some poor fellow who is cast away
on the Ten Thousand Islands,” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>The others looked skeptical.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most of these bottle messages are fakes anyhow,”
said Billy, with an air of finality. But Frank was not
satisfied. He questioned the woman at greater
length. After a long, patient interrogation he found
that her husband, who was absent from the camp, had
been delivering a consignment of moonshine to a camp
of Seminoles in the wildest part of the ’glades and had
found the bottle off the mouth of the Shark River.
It had a tiny bit of red flannel tied round its neck as
if to attract attention to it. This decided Frank. No
joker would have gone to that trouble.</p>

<p class='c009'>He secured the bottle from the squaw for what
seemed to him in his eagerness a ridiculously small
amount, while she in her turn thought the young Hot-ka-tee
(white man) must be crazy to give so much
for it, although to be sure, she esteemed it a valuable
possession.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a heavy stone Frank cracked the neck off his
purchase and eagerly shook out the note it contained.
What he expected to find even he scarcely knew, but
the bottle and its hidden message had appealed
strongly to the boy’s nature,—in which there was a
strong dash of imaginative mingled with the practical
sense that had enabled him to carry so many adventures
to a successful issue.</p>

<p class='c009'>The paper was crumpled up and it took a good
deal of smoothing out before Frank could read the
few faintly pencilled lines that were on its surface.
After much puzzling, however, he made out:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Th-y a &mdash;&mdash; tak&mdash;g m-,” then there was a
long blank that exposure had obliterated. The next
legible words were: “to the ’glades. &mdash;&mdash;stole&mdash;&mdash;ret
of&mdash;&mdash;ite. Send help.”</p>

<div class='c011'>C-----p&mdash;n, U. S. N.</div>

<p class='c009'>For a few seconds the full significance of the words
did not penetrate Frank’s brain. The gaps puzzled
him and he did not pay much attention to the general
significance of the screed. Suddenly, however, the
full meaning of his find fairly leaped at him from the
page.</p>

<p class='c009'>The letter had been written by the missing Lieutenant
Chapin.</p>

<p class='c009'>There could be no doubt of it. Reconstructed the
letter read:</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are taking me into the ’glades. They stole
the secret of Chapinite. Send help. Chapin, U. S. N.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Wildly excited over his discovery Frank’s shout
brought his companions round him in a minute.
Hastily he explained his find. The sensation it
created may be imagined. Here was the first definite
news of the missing man discovered by an extraordinary
chance in the camp of a band of outcast moonshiners.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where was this yere communication found?”
demanded Ben.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank explained where and when the squaw had
told him the moonshiner discovered the bottle. Ben
knitted his brows for a minute and then spoke with
decision.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They took him into the ’glades up one of the
west-shore rivers,” he exclaimed at length. “The
tides on this coast would never have drifted the bottle
round there. It must have come down the river,
maybe from the interior of the ’glades themselves, or
maybe he threw it overboard from the <em>Mist</em> when she
was wrecked.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment there came a startling interruption.
About a dozen of the wild-looking moonshiners appeared,
dragging into the clearing a rumpled heap of
humanity whom the boys at once recognized as the
man they had caught eavesdropping in Washington,
and who had, as they believed, followed them to
Miami after failing to destroy the <em>Golden Eagle</em> at
White Plains.</p>

<p class='c009'>The captive—who is known to our readers from his
signing of the message from Washington to Florida
as Nego—recognized in a flash that he was face to
face with the Boy Aviators.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a fragment of time the group stood as though
carved from stone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c007'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br />THE CAPTIVE’S WARNING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The captive was the first to break the picture.
With a violent wrench he freed himself of the arms
of his captors, while the boys gazed in dumb amazement
at the unexpected encounter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s this here buccaneer bein’ a’ doing of
now?” demanded Ben, after a few seconds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We ’uns caught him trying to scuttle you ’uns
canoes,” explained one of the crackers, “and we calculate
to have him decorating a tree-bough by sundown
on our own account. We don’t like live
strangers round here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The face of the man we know as Nego grew as
yellow as parchment. There was little doubt from the
expressions of the moonshiners’ faces that they were
quite capable of carrying out their threat. In fact a
murmur of approval greeted the cold-blooded proposal.
One man—a little short fellow with a tangle
of black whiskers that reached to his waist—even
pointed to a custard apple-tree that grew at the edge
of the clearing and remarked casually:</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’d look uncommon well decorating that thar
tree I’m thinking.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After the boys had made insistent demands to be
given the details of Nego’s capture they were finally
informed that a group of the moonshiners, who had
been off wild-hog hunting, had been much surprised
to see the motor-boat manœuvring off the point on
the far side of which the boys had beached the canoes.
They stealthily watched the two men who were in the
craft from the screen provided by the mangroves.
One of them—the man they had captured,—continually
scanned the shore with a pair of field-glasses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They must have known we had left the sloop and
come in pursuit of us,” exclaimed Frank and Harry
in one breath as the narrator reached this point of his
story.</p>

<p class='c009'>After rounding the point it appeared that the
watchers, who had been sneaking along through the
undergrowth, saw Nego order the boat’s head pointed
for the shore and when she was fairly close in, get
into a small dinghy that towed astern and come
ashore at the spot where the canoes were lying. He
carried a small axe and was about to raise it and
destroy the craft when the crackers, with a startling
yell, burst out of the woods and made him a captive.
The other man must have seen his comrade’s plight,
for he instantly headed the motor-boat about and
giving her full speed vanished round the projection
on the coast of the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys’ faces paled as a common thought flashed
across their minds. “What if the two men had
visited the sloop and scuttled her or destroyed the
<em>Golden Eagle II</em>?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry was the first to voice their fears. Frank’s
answer, however, gave the adventurers a gleam of
hope.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That occurred to me, Harry,” he replied, “but,
on thinking it over, I think it is more likely that they
planned to destroy the canoes before attacking the
<em>Carrier Dove</em>, as with the small craft stove in they
would be able to work without fear of our paddling
back and surprising them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They agreed that this was a reasonable theory and
turned their attention to the captive who stood defiantly
with folded arms and a sneering expression on
his dark face. He looked very different from the
well-dressed man who had first attracted their attention
in the dining-room at the Hotel Willard, but he
was unmistakably the same despite the fact that now
his chin was covered with a heavy stubble and he
wore rough clothes and a dark blue flannel shirt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are you?” demanded Frank finally.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dark man raised his eyebrows and as he did so
the boys noticed at once the cause of his peculiar expression.
The man’s eyes were almost almond-shaped,
dark and malevolent looking—the eyes of an Oriental.
Combined with his dark yellow skin they stamped
him at once as an unmistakable subject of the ruler
of the far Eastern power the agents of which the
Secretary of the Navy was certain, had kidnapped
Lieutenant Chapin and stolen the formula of his explosive.
When he spoke it was in a rasping voice
that matched well his general appearance of sinister
energy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What if I should refuse to tell you?” he
grated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In that case you would be very foolish,” rejoined
Frank, “you are now in the power of these men,
over whom we have some influence. If you will give
us some information we will in return try to intervene
for you, notwithstanding the fact that you have
tried to blow up our aerodrome and now we find you
here attempting to scuttle our canoes. What have
you done with the colored man you took from the
sloop last night?” he demanded suddenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To that I shall simply reply that he is in good
hands,” was the rejoinder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not if he’s got anything to do with you, he ain’t,
my fine fellow,” put in Ben indignantly. The man
looked at him with cold contempt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may do with me what you will,” he said
proudly, “I shall not sue Americans for my liberty or
even my life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys were amazed at the cool audacity of the
man. With death staring him in the face, surrounded
by the cruel faces of men who would have no hesitancy
in killing him, he showed no more trace of emotion
than if he were still sitting eavesdropping in the Willard
dining-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We ’uns will find a way to make him talk,” broke
in one of the moonshiners, a big, powerful fellow.
“Here, Shadduck, heat up the gun-barrels.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys looked puzzled, but Ben realized at once
the horrible thing the man contemplated. They meant
to brand the prisoner with the red-hot gun-barrels.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Avast there,” he cried, “none of that in this yere
ship. Fair play and all above board. If you want to
string up this fellow to the yard-arm I don’t know, if
it wasn’t for my friends here, that I’d say ‘no,’ but
we ain’t going to have no branding.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are you to be giving orders?” demanded
the man who had made the suggestion angrily and
leaning forward on his rifle, “I reckon we ’uns ain’t
asking for your advice or figgering on taking it
either.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Several of the younger men muttered, “That’s
right—who’s he to come here ’a ordering us about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wouldn’t put it past yer that you’re turned a
revenue,” went on the first speaker following up his
advantage. At this an angry cry went up. The boys
and Ben perceived that matters would soon reach a
crisis if something were not done. Ben, however,
knew how to handle these people better than his
young companions imagined.</p>

<p class='c009'>With two quick steps he was alongside the trouble-maker
and seizing him in an iron grasp put his face
close to his and fairly hissed in his ear:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look a here, ‘Red’ Mavell, one more word
like that and you’re as good as dead—understand?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The other apparently did for he sullenly muttered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ain’t no use a gettin’ het up. You know the
way we do these things an’ if you don’t like ’em you
don’t have to stay and watch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>During this scene Nego had stood as impassively
as if carved out of wood. Indeed with his parchment-like
skin and dark, slit eyes he did resemble an
Oriental ivory image almost as much as a human
being.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was of course evident to him that escape was
impossible. Rugged, wild-eyed moonshiners stood
all about him and the women even had come out of
the huts, with their timid children peeping from behind
their skirts, to be onlookers at the unwonted
scene. The captive retained his posture of proud
defiance in the face of this. His bearing was even insolent
in fact.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, mates,” went on Ben, turning suddenly
to the boys, “we don’t want to have any hand
in killing this here reptile—much reason as we’ve
got to—and we don’t want him to be tortured, and
I’ll be keelhauled if we want to keep him,” he
glanced ferociously at the captive, “the only thing
to do is to turn him loose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The captive’s face lost its impassivity for a moment.
So completely had Ben’s determined manner
cowed the more ruffianly moonshiners that even they
did not demur.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there’s a string hitched to the offer,” went on
Ben, “if we do let yer go you’ve got to make tracks
in that thar motor-boat of yours for the north and
swear to follow us no further. And tell us what
you’ve done with that thar poor coon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, that is our proposal,” said Frank, “if we
get you out of the hands of these people you will have
to pledge us your word to trail us no further and to
leave this part of the country at once—will you do
that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we were only north we’d have you in jail by
this time,” put in Billy angrily.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man was silent for a moment with his eyes
downcast, then he looked up but with some of the expression
of sullen cunning obliterated from his dark
face at least temporarily. It was plain the Americans’
generosity had affected him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do promise—yes,” he said quietly. “My companion
was to wait for me in the motor-boat till I
signaled to him that I was going to put off again. If
you will let me go I promise to go straight on board
and never trouble you again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But they said your companion put about and
drove the boat round the point when he saw your
capture,” objected Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Simply a measure of prudence,” he said. “I can
easily signal him with this,” he drew from his pocket
a small whistle, of the shrill kind known to seafaring
men as the “bos’n’s pipe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” he went on in a grave tone, “I want to do
something to repay you for your kindness which I
confess I do not understand—you Americans are a
queer people.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Blame lucky for you we are,” snorted Ben, who
didn’t much like the cool way the captive took his
good fortune.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not fear for your negro. He is safe. We
put him ashore this morning, and by this time he must
be at your camp. We only carried him off in an attempt
to prevent his giving the alarm. But,” and his
voice sank to a whisper, “give this attempt up. Do
not go into the Everglades.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank gazed at him in astonishment. The tone he
used was full of import.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Grave danger threatens you there,” the other
went on, “more than danger—death itself and in a
terrible form. As for me I have pledged you my
word. I am your country’s enemy, but I know brave
and generous men when I see them; you have no
more to fear from me——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you haven’t done us much harm anyway,”
Frank could not refrain from saying, “though I’ll
admit you have tried,” he added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have but been the agent for others more powerful,
more unscrupulous and more to be feared than I,”
the other replied, “even now your coming is being
looked for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you did spy on us in Washington,” cried
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did, and telegraphed my report to my superiors,”
replied the man, “it was my duty. We soldiers of the
Samurai know no word but duty when we are assigned
to a task.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you are an officer?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am in the Onaki regiment. I fought through
the Russian war and was afterward given the honor
to assist in the enterprise which you are about to
try to frustrate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see much honor in what you and your
countrymen have done,” rejoined Frank warmly; “it
looks to me like plain everyday stealing and worse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps,” replied the other with a slight shrug.
“Our points of view are different. Now,” he said
abruptly, “I must be going. We must be well on
our way north by dark for the inland channels are
very intricate to navigate in and our boat draws a
good deal of water.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Recollect what I have said and be warned,” he
repeated impressively.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he spoke there came a low growl of thunder in
the distance and a heavy splotch of rain fell on the
back of Frank’s hand. They all looked up astonished.
So engrossed had they been by the remarkable scene
that had just transpired that they had not noticed that
for some time the sky had been growing blacker and
that one of the sudden storms, peculiar to the tropics,
had been advancing towards them with all the rapidity
that marks the advent of a “Black Squall,” as they
are sometimes called. The sky had in a few minutes
become overcast completely with an ominous slate-colored
pall. A hush as if of expectancy had fallen
on the jungle about them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are likely to get a ducking if you don’t git
aboard before this yere squall breaks,” growled Ben
as his seaman’s eye noted the signs of bad weather.
The Oriental swept the overcast sky with a quick
glance. He nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-bye and thank you,” he said, and the next
minute, guided by one of the moonshiners, he vanished
down the trail leading to the shore. The moonshiners
turned to the adventurers with sardonic looks
as he disappeared.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ’uns might better have let us hang him,” said
one of them, “he’ll work you a pesky lot of mischief
yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe he will trouble us any more,” rejoined
Frank, who had been impressed by the man’s
earnest manner and evident gratitude. How soon
and how literally his words were to be fulfilled he
little imagined.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c007'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br />THE BLACK SQUALL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The boys were so engrossed in discussing the sudden
conversion of their late enemy to a friend—or at
least to no longer a source of menace—that it was not
till a good ten minutes later that Frank suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The canoes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The spot where they had drawn them up was near
the margin of the sea and the heavy waves that the
approaching storm would stir up would be sure to
swamp them if they were not moved from their present
position.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, boys, we’ve got to hurry,” shouted
Ben, and followed by the young adventurers he dashed
off down the trail that the others had traversed a few
minutes previously. They reached the shore just in
time to hear three shrill blasts from the released captive’s
whistle. He was in his small boat about a
hundred yards off shore and looking anxiously about.
He had good reason to. The thunder-growls were
coming nearer, and far to the south, across the dark
cloud curtains, great jagged flashes of lightning were
ripping and tearing. The sea, too, was beginning to
rise with that peculiar moaning sound that precedes
a mighty disturbance of its waters. The rain
fell in torrents that whitened the surface of the
sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>The work of getting the canoes hauled into a safe
place was soon performed, more especially as they
had the aid of several of the moonshiners who had
accompanied them to the beach to see the last of the
man they would have cheerfully hanged a few
minutes before. The small craft were hardly snugly
stowed when round the point through the downpour,
glided the motor-boat. She was low and long and
painted dull black and must have been equipped with
powerful engines for she shot through the water like
a snake. The man in the dinghy soon clambered
on board and turned to wave farewell to the soaking
group of watchers on the beach.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee! I’d give a hundred dollars for an umbrella,”
remarked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope that’s his good-bye and not <em>au revoir</em>,” remarked
Lathrop. “I think you let him off much too
easy, Frank,” he added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So do I,” put in Lathrop, “he really deserved
some punishment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What were we to do?” asked Frank. “Anyhow
if he doesn’t keep his word we know his measure
now and can look out for him and see he doesn’t get
off so easy next time. Besides, if we had left him
here these moonshiners would have been sure to have
killed him. Ben Stubbs told me they don’t hesitate
to make away with any stranger——-”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who hasn’t got a letter of introduction,” Billy
finished for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it’s a good thing we had a sponsor, or we
might have been ornamenting the foliage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the boy spoke there was a sudden shout from
Ben of:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Holy skysails, look at that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys’ eyes followed the direction in which he
excitedly pointed.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the southward, before the advancing curtain of
lightning torn storm-clouds rolled a great wall of
green water, ridged on the top with a line of flaky-white
foam. It was tearing along toward them at
the rate of an express train.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fascinated by the spectacle of the mighty wave the
boys stood watching it for a moment in awed wonder.
Its great volume was outlined against the background
of cloud as it reared its foamy crest above the dark
level swells like a watery parapet.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they gazed the same thought struck them simultaneously
and a cry of horror broke from the lips of
every member of the group.</p>

<p class='c009'>The motor-boat!</p>

<p class='c009'>It was directly in the path of the advancing mountain
of water.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two men on board the boat, who had been
busied in attaching the dinghy’s painter to the stern
cleats, looked up almost at the same moment as those
ashore realized their peril. The boys saw them
hastily rush to their posts; one forward to the wheel
in the bow, the other bending over the engines which
had been stopped when the dinghy had been picked
up. They were evidently panic-stricken. The noise
of their terrified, confused shouts was borne shoreward
on the wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can we do nothing?” asked Harry, horrified at
the vision of the two doomed men struggling aimlessly
to escape the deadly peril that was bearing
down on them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing,” responded Frank, as agitated as the
younger boy; “if their boat cannot weather that
wave nothing can save them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The sea in the immediate vicinity of the island
began to heave in heavy shouldering swells as the
Black Squall advanced and the wave grew nearer and
even more menacing as its distance from them
decreased. It was apparent that far back as even
the canoes were hauled, they would have to be hauled
further inland if they were to escape damage. This
work was at once set about and the canoes dragged
fully a hundred yards from the beach.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The wave will be all bust up by the mangroves
and they’ll not get much more than a wetting up
here,” remarked Ben.</p>

<p class='c009'>This work done, Frank suggested that they climb
into the branches of a wide-spreading guava tree so
as to be out of harm’s way and also be able to watch
the motor-boat’s fight for life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We might see a chance to help the poor fellows,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moonshiners, with impassive faces, followed
the adventurers’ example and soon all of them were
roosting in the trees. Hardly had they settled when
the mighty wave towered within a few hundred yards
of the black motor-boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The occupants seemed to have lost their heads completely
at the imminence of the danger and were not
even attempting to do anything to relieve the situation.
The man who owed his life to the boys stood
erect in the stern and with his arms folded gazed at
the advancing doom. The other was groveling in
terror on the boat’s thwarts. Suddenly they saw the
man in the stern spring to the engine and crank the
machine desperately. The boat began to move rapidly
through the swells, tossing their heads in spray over
her sharp bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s going to race it,” amazedly exclaimed
Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s not a chance,” cried Frank, as the boat
gathered speed and fled like some frightened creature
before the pursuing peril. She fairly leaped through
the water like a live thing. With parted lips and
throbbing pulses the boys watched the beginning of
the unequal struggle. Gamely as the helmsman guided
the flying craft over the swells the great wave gained
on him. The man who had been groveling in the boat
in sheer terror was now on his feet. He hung onto
the stern coaming and gazed back as if fascinated with
awe at the pursuing Nemesis. The man in the bow
never turned his head; he gazed straight forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly a cry that even the boys could hear broke
from the lips of the man in the stern.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The engine’s stopped!” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even as the words left his lips the giant comber
caught the boat’s stern. It raised her up and up till
she seemed fairly to stand erect on her bow, stern in
air. For an imperceptible segment of time she
remained so.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next second she was blotted out of existence
in a mighty vortex of water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the cry of horror at the swift tragedy that
had been enacted before them had died from the boys’
lips the wave broke on the shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a crash like the explosion of a powder magazine
it smashed itself on the beach and a mighty inrush
of water followed. The spray of its landing
flew as high as the tree-tops.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A good thing we’re up here,” cried Billy, as the
water came swirling through the jungle beneath
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A good thing we hauled the canoes up, you mean,”
said Frank, as he anxiously watched the frail craft—as
far inland as they lay—picked up like feathers and
dashed about by the inroad of the sea. To his relief,
however, they survived their buffeting undamaged,
thanks to their extra strong construction.</p>

<p class='c009'>The water rushed back down the sloping shore of
the island as swiftly as it had advanced. A few
minutes later they were able to descend and hurry to
the beach. There was no danger of a second monster
wave Ben assured them.</p>

<p class='c009'>They suddenly realized though that they were
dripping wet through from the torrential downpour
that had accompanied the storm, but their anxiety to
see if any trace of the motor-boat or her occupants
reappeared prevailed over their discomfort. They
stood on the beach scouring the sea with burning eyes,
but it was empty of life. They remained silently
gazing before them for several minutes—it was Ben
who broke the silence:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about the <em>Carrier Dove</em>? Has the wave
struck her?” were the words that brought them all out
of their reverie with an anxious start.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br />PORK CHOPS PROVES HIS METAL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was impossible to consider rounding the island
in the canoes in the sea that was running; but this
difficulty was got over by Ben, who impressed a guide
from the moonshiners’ settlement to guide them
around to the spot where they had camped, and off
which the <em>Carrier Dove</em> was moored. Arrangements
were also made to have the canoes carried across the
island later by three strapping young crackers, who
were glad of the chance to earn a little money by
proffering their services.</p>

<p class='c009'>These arrangements completed the start across the
island was made, and after about three hours traveling
the boys reached the spot where they had camped.
They hurried anxiously to the beach.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was evident that the storm had not struck this
side of the island with anything like the violence with
which it had broken on the other shore. This raised
the boys’ hopes for a few moments but they were
destined to be as quickly dashed.</p>

<p class='c009'>No <em>Carrier Dove</em> rode at anchor.</p>

<p class='c009'>In fact the usually placid sea, still heaving under the
influence of the squall which had now passed away,
was as devoid of life as a desert as far as their eyes
could reach.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a bitter moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Neither Frank nor Harry dared trust their voices to
speak. They swallowed hard while their eyes brimmed
at this wretched ending of their hopes.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the <em>Carrier Dove</em> gone—and more than that
with the <em>Golden Eagle II</em>, at the bottom of the sea,
it would be useless to keep on. They would have
to turn back and admit they had ignominiously
failed.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Ben Stubbs, he removed his hat, scratched
his head and remarked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’ll be double-darned, horn-swaggled——”</p>

<p class='c009'>That was all, but there was a wealth of meaning in
his tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lathrop and Billy stood to one side, both realized
what the Boy Aviators must be suffering at the sudden
dashing to the earth of their high hopes. A
cruder disappointment could not in fact be imagined.
The work of their brains and the fruit of long experiment
and research had been swallowed by the
same hungry sea that had destroyed two of their
enemies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Practical Ben Stubbs broke the silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here you get along home and tell ’em to send us
some grub,” he ordered the lanky young moonshiner
who had escorted them. “I reckon we’ll camp out
to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the man had hurried off, Ben set to work
getting a fire. When he had it in a bright blaze he
shouted:</p>

<p class='c009'>“All hands to the fire to get dry; no use of dying of
rumatiz even if the sloop is gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys, despondent as they were, saw the wisdom
of his words and crowded about the blaze. They
stripped to their underwear and hung their garments
on a sort of long stick laid across two forked ones
stuck in the ground about six feet apart in front of the
fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, that’s ship-shape,” he remarked when a row
of wet clothes were hung on his handiwork to dry in
the warmth, “next thing to do is to consider the
situation, as the young man said when they offered
him a good job as hangman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ben’s flow of spirits had an effect on all the boys,
who sat dejectedly around the fire in their wet underclothes.
To tell the truth the old adventurer was
far from feeling as cheerful as he tried to appear,
but like all men who have faced real hardships
he knew the value of making the best of a situation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Frank with a melancholy smile.
“What do you make of it, Ben?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did that there poor fellow that’s drownded
say to you he done with Pork Chops?” was the irrelevant
reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, he said that they had put him ashore early
to-day,” replied Frank. “I don’t see what that’s got
to do with it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Might have a good deal,” replied Ben. “I
wonder where that black lubber is. He’ll have fifty-seven
varieties of fits when he finds his boat’s gone—worse’n
the skipper’s cat that lost all his nine lives at
once when the shop’s rats gave out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He can easily replace that rickety old sloop,” said
Harry irritably; “to restore what we have lost will
take months of work and more money than we can
get.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we can even get back to New York from this
moonshining island we’ll be lucky,” grumbled Lathrop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, don’t rub it in,” muttered Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was very plain that all the young adventurers
were overwrought. More for the sake of creating a
diversion than anything else, Ben said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wonder what’s become of that floating pumpkin-seed
the Squeegee?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Washed away, I suppose,” said Frank in an uninterested
tone. The loss of the ungraceful Squeegee
didn’t interest him much at that moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’d have been washed inshore by the waves,”
mused Ben, “if she’d been driven anywhere; besides
I hitched her to that tree yonder down by the beach.
Hullo, that’s funny,” he broke off suddenly and
rapidly walked toward the tree to which the Squeegee’s
painter had been hitched. He examined the
surface. There was no bit of rope hanging to it as
he knew would have been the case if the painter had
been snapped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Someone untied that rope,” said Ben to himself
in a tone of deep conviction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hastening up the beach to where the boys were
grouped Ben confided his discovery to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who do you suppose took it?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some no-good moonshiner, I suppose,” snorted
Ben indignantly. “Keelhaul those fellows, they’re a
natural born pest, the whole boiling of them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think they could have weathered the
squall in her?” asked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ben laughed incredulously. “No, sir,” he replied.
“I doubt he’d last out a squall as long in that craft
as it would take a sailor to eat a piece of plum-duff.
Whoever took that boat is at the bottom of the sea
by now and the Squeegee along with him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was dusk when the young moonshiner returned
loaded with provisions for which the boys against
his protest insisted on paying. There was a big
piece of roast venison, sour-dough bread, roast land
crab, a plethoric pot of beans and a plentiful supply of
cassava cakes—even coffee had not been forgotten.
Everybody cheered up a little at the sight of the food.
It is wonderful what heart a good meal, even in prospect,
can put into a healthy boy, and our young adventurers
were no exception to the rule. Declining
their invitation to stay and share the meal the young
moonshiner plunged off hurriedly into the home trail.</p>

<p class='c009'>In fifteen minutes Ben had the coffee ready and the
cassava cakes heated on hot stones. After a hearty
meal, of which indeed they stood in need, the party
donned their clothes,—which were now thoroughly
dry,—and earnestly discussed their prospects. Only
Ben, who sat apart, took no hand in the conversation.
Only once, however, he irrelevantly remarked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keelhaul that Pork Chops, where is he?”</p>

<p class='c009'>That the boys did not sleep their usual peaceful
slumbers that night may be imagined. For hours they
tossed and turned under their blankets and watched
the fire die down and fade first to a ruddy glow and
then to blackness.</p>

<p class='c009'>It might have been an hour after midnight when
the moon rose and shimmered over the sea, now perfectly
smooth. Had their minds been at ease the boys
would have been enraptured with the beauty of the
tropic night. As it was, however, the coming of the
moon and the illumination of the sea merely served
Frank as an opportunity further to scan the scene for
any trace of the <em>Carrier Dove</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Casting off his blanket he hastened to the strip of
beach on which the smooth swells were breaking with
a milder thunder than usual. With his night-glasses
he swept the midnight sea from horizon to horizon.
There was no result. Thoroughly dejected he cast
himself at the foot of a huge palmetto and gazed intently
out to sea riveting his mind on the present situation
of himself and the little band of which the Boy
Aviators were the leaders.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly the current of his gloomy thoughts was
broken in on by an occurrence which brought him to
his feet with a bound.</p>

<p class='c009'>A low lying group of brilliant stars just above the
horizon had been blotted out. Something had passed
between the boy and the stars. That something could
only be a sail, and a sail meant at least rescue from
the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a bound Frank, glasses in hand, was knee-deep
in the surf.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a sail!</p>

<p class='c009'>With trembling hands he brought the glasses to a
better focus. Intently he gazed till his eyes burned
in his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>The craft was a sloop!</p>

<p class='c009'>Hardly daring to admit to his mind the wild hope
that had suddenly arisen, Frank watched the strange
sail as it grew nearer. Before the gentle breeze the
craft advanced slowly to within a hundred yards of
shore and then a dark figure bounded along her decks
and there was a loud rattle from her cable as the
anchor was let go and she swung into the wind with
flapping mainsail. Another moment and her canvas
was lowered with a run and she lay at anchor.</p>

<p class='c009'>With his heart in his mouth Frank hailed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Carrier Dove</em>, ahoy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dat you, Marse Frank—bress de Lawd—bress de
Lawd!” came back across the water in Pork Chops’
rasping voice; but had it been the golden tones of an
opera singer that answered his hail the sound could
not have been sweeter to Frank’s ear at that moment
than Pork Chops’ frog-like croak of welcome.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>The Golden Eagle II</em> was safe!</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the echo of the <em>Carrier Dove’s</em> noisy arrival
had died out in the woods, the young adventurers,
hand-in-hand, were dancing in a wild circle round the
bewildered Ben Stubbs, yelling like Comanches.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br />THE FRONT DOOR OF THE ’GLADES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There was little more sleep for the boys that night
and when at daybreak half-a-dozen of the moonshiners
appeared with the canoe it may be imagined that the
boys lost little time in getting aboard the <em>Carrier Dove</em>
where their inky navigator was so delighted to see
them that he danced a sort of double shuffle of joy
from one end of his disreputable craft to the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>The story of how the <em>Carrier Dove</em> had come to
weather the storm was soon told. After the two men,
who had not harmed him, had set him ashore from the
motor-boat at the other end of the island the black,
with the instinct of locality common to his race, had
easily made his way to the camp. To his amazement
it was deserted and he was filled with fear that some
disaster had happened to the boys and Ben. He had
not much time for speculation however, for hardly
had he looked about him when the rapid approach of
the black squall that had caused such havoc on the
other side of the island made him bestir himself to get
his beloved <em>Carrier Dove</em> to a safer place than her
present anchorage. He therefore jumped into the
Squeegee and rowed out to his craft. He had just
time to set her sails and up anchor when the squall
struck down in all its fury. Pork Chops told his story
with a wealth of gesture and dramatic effect and the
boys could hardly refrain from bursting into roars
of laughter as he described “de mon’surious wabe
what had rised up out of the sea like yeast bread an’
et up de po’ li’l Squeegee.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How high was the wave. Pork Chops?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Bout as high as de highes’ mountain you ever see,
Marse Frank, and dat am a solemn gospel fact,”
averred Pork Chops. “He ris’ so high above de ol’
<em>Carrier Dobe’s</em> mas’ dat it ’peared lak I could’n see
no sky.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, come, Pork Chops,” laughed Harry, “you’ll
have to take a little off the top of that wave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’ tak off not a single solingtary inch, Marse
Harry,” indignantly replied the skipper of the sloop.
“I wish ah may nevah see Miami again ef dat dar
wabe weren’t jus’ as I done describe him to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it was pretty big and that’s a fact,” said
Billy Barnes with a wink at the others, “but you must
have magnifying eyes to see it as big as you describe
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hoi’ on dar a minute, Marse Barnes,” earnestly
said the old negro, “ah don’ know jus’ what you
mean by dat dar magnaminous eye, but tell me didn’
you all see dat dar wabe from de udder side ob de
island?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly,” said Lathrop, “what’s that got to do
with it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, it mus’ jus’ naturally have growed by de
time it got round here; das all ah got to say,” triumphantly
concluded the old darky.</p>

<p class='c009'>Continuing his narrative Pork Chops told how the
little sloop had driven through the water “faster
than de fastest ex-press you eber seen.” He didn’t
forget either to pay himself a high tribute to his own
skill as a mariner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Reckon dat ol’ man Noah didn’t have nothin’ on
Cap’n Pok Chops when it come to sailin’ roun’ wid
skill and duxturity,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” commented Frank, “we don’t want to
spoil you by too much praise, Pork Chops, but that
certainly was an A No. 1 feat of yours, and I never
heard a more welcome sound than that croak of yours
when you dropped anchor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After despatching huge quantities of fried bacon
and coffee, cooked on the battered sea stove the <em>Carrier
Dove’s</em> cabin boasted, and which Pork Chops proudly
referred to as “de galley,” the adventurers up anchored
and with their little engine chugging merrily
away stood on toward the south. The canoes in a
long tandem-like line were towed astern, as there was
every prospect of smooth water for the rest of the
day.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the <em>Carrier Dove</em> bore past the southern end of
the island a canoe shot round the point. In it were
two figures. One was the moonshiner who had been
so anxious to despatch the unfortunate Nego, the other
was a younger man whom the boys recollected to have
seen in the camp the day before. They waved and
shouted something that the boys could not catch but,
as they evidently had some important object in paddling
out, the young commander ordered the engine
stopped and the <em>Carrier Dove</em> lay to, rising and falling
on the long swells over which the canoe rode as gracefully
as a sea-bird.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few moments later the canoe ran alongside and
the elder of the two men addressing Frank said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, the bodies of them two came ashore this
morning and on the one you wouldn’t let us string up
we found this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He fumbled in his homespun shirt a minute and
then produced a tiny carved figure of green jade.
It was the image of a squatting Buddha and evidently
of great antiquity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was this all you found?” said Frank, examining
the quaint figure with interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure,” replied the other unblushingly, “ain’t it
worth something to you ’uns for we ’uns to hev
fetched it to you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank knew that the man lied when he said that the
little jade god had been the only thing found on the
dead man but he did not deem it worth while to contradict.
He had little doubt that the dead man’s watch
and diamond rings were at that moment in the possession
of the individual who had addressed him, or
some other of the moonshiners. He, however, took
the hint conveyed in the man’s last words and handed
him over a bill. The fellow took it without a word
and shoved off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ’uns may get out of the ’glades alive but I
don’t believe it,” were his parting words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s got what you might call a nice sweet disposition
that feller,” remarked Ben, as the canoe was
rapidly paddled away and the adventurers got under
way once more, “he’d make a good shipmate, he
would, with that sunny nature of hisn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank examined the little jade god with close attention
while the others leaned over his shoulders.
The figure was not much more than two inches high
and of beautiful workmanship. It was evidently of
great antiquity and seemed to have been venerated
as a charm by successive generations, for it was
worn quite smooth in parts as if from constant
rubbing against the clothing of the person wearing
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the top of the head there was a small opening,
round the edges of which were inscribed characters
that were meaningless to the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you suppose is the significance of it?”
asked Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is evidently some sort of an amulet,” responded
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve seen ’em in China and Japan,” put in Ben
Stubbs, “whistling gods they call ’em there. Lend it
here a minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank handed it to him and Ben put his lips
to the orifice at the top of the figure’s head. He
blew hard in it and the figure gave out a clear,
penetrating note that evidently traveled a long distance,
for the two moonshiners stood up in their
now distant canoe and gazed back in astonishment at
the sound.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Them Chinas and Japs set a high value on these,”
commented Ben, “some of ’em would give their lives
for one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we’ll keep it as a souvenir,” remarked
Frank, slipping it in his pocket. “It will be amusing
to have it to recall some of our adventures when we
get back to New York.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That afternoon a good brisk breeze from the northwest
sprang up and the <em>Carrier Dove</em> with her canvas
spread bowled along at a good ten knots before it,
heeling over till the foam creamed at her lee scuppers.
It was exhilarating sailing. After a long series of
alternate calms and favoring breezes the adventurers’
craft finally rounded Cape Sable and shortly afterwards
entered the maze of channels, islands,
sandbars and treacherous shoals that make up the Ten
Thousand Island Archipelago.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young adventurers had finished the first stage
of their daring enterprise. By far the most difficult
part lay before them. As Frank put it they had arrived
“at the front door of the Everglades,” what lay
beyond was only conjecture.</p>

<p class='c009'>According to the prearranged plan they were to
cruise about at the edge of the archipelago till the <em>Tarantula</em>
hove in sight and they could make final arrangements
for wireless codes and signals and also complete
the plan of rescuing Lieutenant Chapin and getting
the formula out of the hands of those who had it.
After two days of waiting, which sadly irritated the
boys, who were keenly impatient to begin their task,
one morning the placid waters of the gulf were furrowed
by the sharp bow of the <em>Tarantula</em> and the
<em>Carrier Dove</em> sailed out to meet her.</p>

<p class='c009'>On board the destroyer the boys were greeted by a
very youthful looking lieutenant, whose name was
Selby. He explained that his orders were to keep in
constant touch with the expedition, so far as was possible,
by wireless and that if they were missing without
sending any word for more than a week he was to
take a squad of men and penetrate the Everglades in
search of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was very anxious for the boys to take several
picked men of his crew along with them in their bold
dash. But Frank and Harry, after a brief consultation,
agreed that the force they had at present formed
a good working unit and there was no need of shortening
their supplies and overloading the canoes by
taking any more. After a dinner aboard the hospitable
<em>Tarantula</em> the boys dropped over the side into
the <em>Carrier Dove</em>, which had lain sociably alongside
the grim war-vessel while they were aboard, and with
warm words of farewell from Lieutenant Selby and
a cheer from the crew, among whom word of what
was on foot had spread in some mysterious way, they
started for the maze of islets and channels beyond
which lay the mouth of the Shark River. They anchored
that night off a small island covered with a
dense undergrowth that promised snakes and that
there was at least one variety of reptile ready to receive
them was evidenced when, as the <em>Carrier Dove’s</em>
anchor rattled down into about twelve feet of water,
a huge body slipped off the bank and slid into the
water with a sullen splash.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An alligator!” cried the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sah,” rejoined Pork Chops, “dat dar ain’t
no ’gator, dat’s a crokindile and where dey are dere’s
mischief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are they more dangerous than alligators?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“More dangerouser!” scornfully replied Pork
Chops. “Ah should jes’ say dey is. ’Gators—huh!
they am big cowards, but crokindile he’ll fight yer till
his teef drap out—yes, sah, they’s bad critters is
crokindiles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like to get that fellow’s skin though,” said
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old darky scratched his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, sah,” he said; “I ain’t saying that dat’s impossible.
’Spose we try to git him by jacklight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By jacklight?” exclaimed Lathrop wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve read about that,” replied Frank, “it is supposed
to be the most effective way of trapping these
saurians. Now as there isn’t much to do before tomorrow,
after we have unloaded our duffle and got it
stowed in the canoes, we might as well have a little
pot-hunt after supper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys enthusiastically agreed and the work of
getting the duffle off the <em>Carrier Dove</em> and into the
canoes for transportation into the Everglades went
ahead with a will. By supper time the canoes which
were to be occupied by Frank and Harry were completely
loaded and there only remained the stowing of
the few additional sections of the <em>Golden Eagle II</em> in
the craft that were to be paddled and poled by Billy
Barnes, Lathrop and Ben.</p>

<p class='c009'>Supper over, old Pork Chops rigged a lantern up in
the bow of one of the canoes and fitted a strip of canvas
over it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No use letting Mister Crokindile know what we’re
going to do till we git ready,” he remarked as he
hooded the light.</p>

<p class='c009'>As only one of the canoes could be used, the others
being loaded down, it was agreed that Frank and
Harry should occupy it with old Pork Chops and the
others would watch the fun from the deck of the
<em>Carrier Dove</em>. The spot where the <em>Carrier Dove</em> lay
was a sort of natural basin enclosed by the thickly
grown islands all about. Pork Chops paddled almost
noiselessly into about the center of the enclosed pool
and then stopped. Then came a dead silence for more
than half an hour broken only by the occasional
nightcry of some bird or creature of the jungle and the
sharp clicks of the adventurers’ rifles as they got them
ready for action.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly the quiet was broken by a roar like that
of an enraged bull.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heah he comes foh shuh,” commented Pork Chops
with his hand on the hood of his lantern.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br />CLOSE QUARTERS WITH ’GATORS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The roar that had startled them was, as Pork Chops
explained to the boys in a low undertone, the mating
cry of the huge crocodile which was now probably on
its way to the den in which they had surprised it
earlier in the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you all ready?” whispered Harry to Frank,
as both boys distinctly heard the rushing noise made
by the huge creature as it leisurely swam through the
still water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank grasped his rifle. Harry already had his
leveled, ready for use as soon as Pork Chops’ jack
lantern illuminated the quarry. They had not long to
wait.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, den, sah,” cried Pork Chops as he raised
the hood of the lantern and a ray of light shot out
across the water. As if fascinated by the sudden illumination
a great cruel head armed with rows of saber-like
teeth suddenly flashed into view.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let him have it,” shouted Frank as both he and
Harry fired.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a repetition of the roar as their bullets
bored home but mingled with it was a loud shout from
the <em>Carrier Dove</em>, that for the moment put all thoughts
of the success or failure of their shots out of the boys’
heads. The cry came from Billy and it was sufficiently
alarming considering that the water fairly swarmed
with alligators and the more vicious crocodiles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lathrop’s overboard!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A thrill of horror shot through both boys as they
heard the words. At Frank’s swift command the old
negro switched the canoe round as if she been on a
pivot and the next minute the ray of the jack lantern
was sweeping the water in the direction of the <em>Carrier
Dove</em>. Lathrop, carried away by excitement as the
boys’ rifles had been discharged, had leaned far over
the side of the sloop, hanging on by a frayed lanyard.
This had parted under his weight and he was now
struggling in the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy Barnes and Ben Stubbs had thrown him ropes
but the bewildered boy, half stunned by the shock of
his sudden immersion, could not see them. He swam
blindly about in the fetid water trying to grasp the
side of the sloop. It was so dark, however, that partially
dazed as he was he did not seem able to find it.
When the ray of the jack lantern fell on his white
dripping face he had about given up hope.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold on, Lathrop,” shouted Frank as, urged by
Pork Chops’ powerful strokes, the canoe shot toward
the struggling boy. In their excitement all the occupants
of the frail craft had quite forgotten about the
big bull crocodile they had wounded. They were reminded
of his presence in a startling fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without the slightest warning the canoe seemed to
be propelled into the air as the powerful tail of the
wounded saurian struck it, and the next minute its
occupants were struggling in the water in as bad a
fix as Lathrop. Both boys were powerful swimmers
but both realized that all their skill would not avail to
save them in the fix in which they found themselves.
As for Pork Chops his terror was pitiable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh Lawd! oh Lawd! I didn’t mean no harm
when I stole ole Aunt Liza’s white pullet,” here he was
half-choked by water. “Oh Lawd, git me out ob
dis widout been all chawed up by crokindiles an’ I
won’t never steal folks’ fowls agin, Lawd. O-o-o-o-oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He broke off with a yell of real terror. Frank
swimming toward the <em>Carrier Dove</em> felt a huge body
brush by him in the water and frantically stroked
toward his goal. Harry was safe, he could hear him
breathing as he swam. But poor Pork Chops! The
unfortunate black had given himself up for lost
when there was a sudden blinding flash of light from
the sloop and at the same minute two rifles cracked.
The amazed boys, struggling in the water to gain the
sloop, saw in the sudden white glare the reptile’s black
head with monstrous opened jaws suddenly checked
in its rush on the apparently doomed Pork Chops as
Billy Barnes and Ben pumped the lead out of the
rifles into the wounded crocodile’s mate as fast as they
could work them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The huge body swung clean out of the water in its
death agony and fell back with a mighty splash. Great
clouds of awakened herons flew from the islets round
about and the whole forest rang with the cries of
aroused birds.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ben Stubbs had had the presence of mind to seize
and ignite one of the signal flares and it was by its
powerful light that they had saved the lives of Pork
Chops and possibly of the boys. With the illumination
afforded by the glare it didn’t take long for the boys
to get aboard the <em>Carrier Dove</em> where Lathrop in a
very shamefaced way related how he came to tumble
overboard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s all the fault of your rotten rigging,” he said
indignantly, looking at the dripping Pork Chops who
was still so scared that he could hardly speak. The
insult to his Carrier Dove, however, fired him with a
righteous wrath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What you all mean, Marse Lathrop, by saying
dose unkindnesses ’bout dis yar ship of mine?” he
sputtered indignantly. “I’d have you to understan’
dat she’s jes’ as fine a craf’ as der is on dis yer Flahda
coas’, yes, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg your pardon,” laughed Lathrop, who now
that the danger was over had quite recovered his usual
flow of spirits, “I didn’t mean to insult you. However,”
he went on more gravely, “if it hadn’t been for
Billy and Ben here I doubt if any of us would have
been alive now to even hurt your feelings.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course a great handshaking between the boys
and their rescuers took place, and as for Pork Chops
he swore that he would not leave the boys whom he
hailed as his “sabyers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The original plan had been that he was to sail the
<em>Carrier Dove</em> back to Miami as soon as the boys started
into the ’glades, but he absolutely refused to hear of
this now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sah, you saved mah wuthless life, an’ ah
means ter stick ter yer jes’ as long as mah laigs ul
carry me,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c009'>From this determination he could not be swayed
and when they turned in that night it had been arranged
that the old black was to accompany them, occupying
a part of Lathrop’s canoe, and that the <em>Carrier
Dove</em> was to remain at anchor where she was;—at all
events for a time. In that little frequented maze of
keys and mangrove-grown shoals there was small
likelihood of anybody finding her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning all hands were astir early. It
was a wonderful scene into the midst of which they
had penetrated. Through the confused huddle of
keys and islets silver-clear channels threaded their
way. In them thousands of fish—silvery tarpon, vampire-like
devil-fish, big and little sharks, rushed and
sported, eating and being eaten in turns. It was fascinating
to watch the active submarine life going on
about them.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for the birds, when the sun arose there were
great clouds of them sailing across the sky or regarding
the adventurers’ preparations for abandoning the
<em>Carrier Dove</em> with the greatest interest. Big snowy
herons, green herons, rose-colored herons, blue herons,
long-legged herons like soldiers on yellow stilts, stood
about, sentinel-like on the oyster bars on which they
found their daily food. Ducks, coots and cormorants
floated about on the placid waters almost as tame as
the domestic varieties.</p>

<p class='c009'>Overhead the sky was almost darkened at times by
huge flocks of snowy ibises, their beautiful plumage
flashing in the sun as they rose and fell in undulating
waves. Gannets, gulls and ospreys hovered about
the great fishing grounds of the archipelago and high
up in the sky, mere specks against the brilliant blue,
sailed on serene pinions the men-of-war hawks and
frigate-birds that haunt the Everglades in vast numbers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately after breakfast the <em>Carrier Dove’s</em>
hatch and cabin were locked and the start was made.
Frank and Harry in their canoes led the way. Billy
Barnes followed, his craft containing the wireless apparatus.
The procession was taken up by Ben Stubbs
while last of all came Lathrop and old Pork Chops, in
whose canoe was loaded the commissariat. Frank and
Harry had most of the sections of the <em>Golden Eagle II</em>
in their craft, as they wished to keep them under their
immediate eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the boys felt a solemn feeling of responsibility—almost
of loneliness—creep over them as, after
Frank had taken and carefully noted with sextant and
horizon the exact bearing of the <em>Carrier Dove’s</em> anchorage,
so that they could easily find her again, the
start into the unknown began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s to the success of the Chester Relief Expedition!”
shouted Billy Barnes as after everything had
been checked up and found complete the little band
dipped their paddles into the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>The others started to cheer but a sharp order from
Frank checked them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“From now on,” he ordered, “everybody must
keep as quiet as possible. We do not know but that
eyes and ears unknown to us are even now taking note
of our every action.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And so in silence, save for the steady dip-dip of
their paddles the Chester Relief Expedition glided
through the wilderness of mangrove keys and blind
channels always due east toward the heart of the Everglades.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c007'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br />AN ISLAND MYSTERY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was an exhilarating sensation, this of being
afloat on their own keels and gliding easily among
sights so strange and new. On every yellow sand-spit
alligators lay sunning themselves and slid into the
water with lazy splashes as the expedition shot round
points onto them. Sometimes they didn’t even trouble
to do this but lay blinking at the canoes as much as to
say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurry up by, and let us get to sleep again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What if they should take it into their heads to
attack us?” asked Lathrop of Pork Chops. The boy’s
face paled as sometimes the old black, with deliberate
defiance as it seemed, steered so close to the alligator
bars that the boy could have put out a hand and
touched the backs of the monsters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’ you give ye’self no fuss ’bout dem ’gators
’tacking us, Marse Lathrop,” the old man reassured
him, “why, ef I het one ob dem varmints a slap wid
dis yar paddle he’d skedaddle so quick yo couldn’ see
his trail for hurry—yes, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The first night’s halt was made at a beautiful little
island overgrown thickly with palmetto, bay, water-oak,
wild-fig, mastic and other timber. Through the
amber water that surrounded it fish of a dozen varieties
glided through the brilliantly colored water-grasses,
that waved in as great luxuriance as the land-growth.
While Pork Chops built a fire and busied
himself with getting supper Frank and Harry sat apart
and discussed their plans. They intended to select
the first available place for the setting up of the <em>Golden
Eagle II</em>, and then do a little scouting by aeroplane.
Frank knew from report that scattered through the
wilderness of the Everglades there are numerous hammocks
or small hills, in some cases quite considerable
mounds, that would make ideal sites for a central
camp. It was not much use speculating on any further
method of procedure, however, till they were actually
in the Everglades.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the boys had been busying themselves in this
way Ben Stubbs had taken a rifle and strolled off into
the jungle in search of one of the wild turkeys whose
loud “Keouk-keouks” had apprised him that the
bronze beauties were plentiful in the brush. Lathrop
and Billy Barnes went fishing with improvised hooks
and lines made of stout thread from their toilet-bags.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two anglers were shouting with delight over a
huge reddish colored fish that Lathrop had hooked
and drawn to shore, after a struggle in which it seemed
that his line must part or he go overboard, when Ben
Stubbs returned from his hunting expedition. He
carried with him a fine big gobbler that must have
weighed fully twenty pounds. While they were all
gathered about the beautiful bird admiring the rich,
coppery gloss of its feathers, Lathrop, who had been
busy disentangling his line from a low-growing bush,
gave a sudden yell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter?” shouted Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy came running toward him. His face was
white and he held out his right hand for their inspection.
On the thumb were two tiny bluish punctures.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no need to ask questions. The boy had
got a snake bite. The question was,—had a poisonous
reptile bitten him?</p>

<p class='c009'>Lathrop, what with terror and pain from the fever
that was coursing through his veins like molten lead,
was too terror-stricken to answer Frank’s questions
intelligibly. He finally described, however, a snake
which they did not doubt was a rattler,—a diamond
back,—one of the most deadly pests of the Everglades.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The medicine chest quick, Harry,” ordered Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>The younger boy darted to the canoes and soon returned
with the outfit labelled “For Snake Bites.”
With quick dexterity Frank had rolled up Lathrop’s
sleeve while Harry was getting the remedies, and
with a short stick had twisted a handkerchief above
the bite so tightly that it was almost buried in the skin.
This was to prevent the poison spreading up the arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, while Lathrop winced with the pain but endured
it bravely, Frank slashed two deep cuts in his
forearm which bled freely. From the snake-bite outfit
Frank rapidly selected some dark-red tablets of
permanganate of potassium and rapidly dissolved
them in water. By this time Lathrop was in agony.
His heart felt as if it was being gripped in a red-hot
vise and he had great difficulty in breathing. A
strange drowsiness crept over him. Nothing seemed
to matter if he could only sleep and forget the pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leave me alone,” he panted to Frank. “I guess
I’d rather die.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young leader recognized the seriousness of
these symptoms and worked with feverish haste. He
fitted a needle onto a hypodermic syringe and seizing
a fold of the stricken boy’s skin between his thumb
and forefinger he ran the needle almost up to its
end in Lathrop’s arm—after having filled the squirt
with the permanganate solution. Then, wrapped in
blankets, the boy was laid down, while Frank and
Harry watched anxiously at his side. After an hour
they breathed more freely as Lathrop opened a pair of
languid eyes and announced that the pain about his
heart had moderated. The next morning he was still
so weak, however, that to move him was manifestly
impossible.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys were in a quandary. They could not
leave him and yet time was precious. They must
press on. An unexpected solution to the problem was
found when Frank and Harry, after spending half a
day exploring the little key, announced that they had
found a deserted plantation house on the northerly
end of it, and that better than that even, there was a
quite considerable clearing about the abandoned house
that would make an excellent “take off” for the
<em>Golden Eagle II</em>. It was decided that night to go to
work at once to put the aeroplane together right there
and abandon the canoe expedition.</p>

<p class='c009'>The house that Frank and Harry had found had evidently
been long deserted. It was built of clay daubed
over plaited branches of the mastic tree and roofed
with palmetto leaves. Its door, a queer contrivance
of twisted branches and palmetto leaves hung from
broken hinges formed by loops of pliable twigs, bent
round large crooked sticks set into the frame. All
about it stretched a clearing in which apparently the
former proprietor had carried on some sort of farming
operations. But its condition showed that like
the house it had been unused for many years.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who do you suppose could have built it?” asked
Harry as the boys gazed about them at the dismal
scene of desolation and abandonment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some fellow anxious to keep out of the way I
should imagine,” put in Ben Stubbs, who was already
busy with a mattock clearing up a space of ground
on which to begin operations,—for this conversation
took place the morning following the boys’ discovery
of the hut and the clearing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or maybe a sailor who was marooned here,” put
in Billy Barnes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, that’s more like it,” commented Ben. “Now
I come to think of it, pirates used to be thick in
among these yere islands and depend upon it that this
place was put up by one of them poor fellows as they
had put ashore for some fancied offence or other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As if to confirm this theory it was not much later
that Billy, poking about the clearing, found way off
in one corner, under a huge cabbage-palm, a board
stuck at one end of a low mound, evidently a grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy’s shout at once brought the others clustering
about him, and after Ben’s knife had scraped away
the mould and dirt with which the years had coated
the head-board they read:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Jem Bristol,—a sailor of the Walrus. Died May
21, 1775. Berried Here by His Ship matz.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Underneath in smaller letters was cut the inscription:</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was maruned here for five years been found
by us as he was diing. The krew of the Murmade.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor fellow,” exclaimed Billy, “marooned here
for five years, what a fate!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose that the Walrus was some sort of a
pirate ship?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I think I remember reading somewhere that
Captain Flint, a famous sea-rover, called his ship by
that name,” chimed in Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, them fellers from the Mermaid, however
they got here, done what they could for the fellow,”
commented Ben Stubbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just the same they only found him when it was
too late to do anything for him but bury him,” commented
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a good morning’s work transporting the
packing cases containing the sections of the air-ship
across the island and when it was completed all hands
were glad to sit down and partake of a lunch of reef
oysters, pilot bread, fried bacon washed down with
tablet lemonade prepared by Pork Chops. Lathrop
was so far recovered as to be able to drink some
oyster broth and after he had taken the nourishment
he declared that he felt strong enough to be moved.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys had reached the decision that it would be
a good plan to transport the entire camp to the clearing
and occupy the dead sailor’s house as a more comfortable
permanent camp than they could erect
themselves. The rest of the day was devoted to putting
this idea into execution and carrying Lathrop, in a
sort of stretcher made out of one of the canoe-tents
and two long branches across the island. The canoes
were then poled round the island to a little bay with a
shelving beach that cut into the land opposite the new
camp which by unanimous consent had been christened
Walrus Camp. The little craft were dragged up to a
point above tide-water, for the waters about the island
were still tidal. That evening, when the lamp was lit
and the mouldering house of the maroon neatly swept
out and the boys’ possessions all put in place, the young
adventurers declared it was as comfortable a dwelling
as one could find.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Pork Chops, he was fairly delighted with the
place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dis am as framjous as any palace I ever did done
see,” he exclaimed, rubbing his hands in satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What palaces have you ever seen?” asked Frank
quizzingly of the old man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pork Chops, with a look of great superiority, replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah’s seen palaces an’ palaces. Moren’ you could
shak’ a stick at,” he replied indignantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The exact location of Pork Chops’ palaces and the
eagerly demanded definition of the mysterious word
“framjous” was indefinitely postponed by a startling
occurrence at this juncture.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ben Stubbs, who had been sitting by the door almost
keeled over. Lathrop in his enfeebled condition
set up a startled cry. Even Frank and Harry turned
a shade paler. As for Billy his eyes almost popped
out of his head. With a loud cry of “Fo’ de Lawd’s
sake, spookses!” Pork Chops leaped from beside his
stove, upsetting his pots with a loud crash. What
had occurred was in fact sufficiently startling considering
their lonely surroundings.</p>

<p class='c009'>Somebody had knocked at the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was the first to recover his senses. Revolver
in hand he dashed across the floor and flung the door
wide open. Eagerly his eyes searched the night but
without result.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was nobody to be seen!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br />THE BOYS MAKE AN ACQUISITION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Headed by Ben Stubbs with the lantern the young
adventurers rushed after Frank into the open, determined
to ascertain if possible the meaning of the
strange and startling interruption to their peaceful
evening. It was in vain, however, that they searched
for any indication of the presence of a human being.
In the blackness it was indeed impossible to make
more than a cursory examination of the surroundings
of the hut.</p>

<p class='c009'>At daybreak, however, after a restless night, Frank,
who had risen as soon as the first gray of dawn
made things dimly visible, uttered a cry of surprise
from outside the hut. Hastily flinging off their coverings
and slipping into their clothes the others ran out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here,” exclaimed Frank, “what do you
make of this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He held up a small bottle in which was a bit of red
flannel, a chicken feather, some rusty nails and several
dried grasshoppers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I found it put right to one side of the door sill,”
he explained. “How we missed finding it last night
I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What can it mean?” chorused the other boys
peering eagerly at the strange object.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Looks as if some mischievous kid had put it
there,” suggested Billy Barnes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think there are likely to be any ’mischievous
kids,’ as you call them, about here, Billy,” said
Frank with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I give it up,” said Harry; “I never was
much good at reading riddles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just let me look at it a moment, shipmate,” put in
Ben Stubbs quietly. “I kinder think I have an inkling
of what it means.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He took the bottle and examined it carefully. Then
he nodded his head sagely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s some kind ’er voodoo for certain shu,” exclaimed
Pork Chops. “I wouldn’t touch dat lilly
bottle fo’ all de money in dis yer worl’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did you say it was, Pork Chops, you inky
pirate?” asked Ben, turning on him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lan’ sakes, don’ snap me up dat er way, Marse
Stubbs,” gasped the old negro, “I only said I wouldn’
touch dat bottle. It’s voodoo fo’ shu’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right you are, my boy,” cried Ben, “only it’s
not voodoo; but it’s something very like it. It’s
obeah.“</p>

<p class='c009'>“Obeah!” exclaimed Frank, “what on earth is
that, Ben?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, it’s a form of witchcraft used by the ignorant
negroes of the West Indies and Bahama islands,”
explained Ben. “It’s meant as a warning to any one
on whose doorstep it is placed. In this case, as I take
it, it means, ‘Don’t come no further.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” laughed Frank, “it will take more than a
bottle of dried bugs and old chicken feathers to make
us turn back, and anyway, how comes a West Indian
negro here? If it was a Seminole now——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a puzzle to me too,” remarked Ben.
“Then Seminoles don’t use nothing like this that
ever I heard of.—What’s that?” he broke off suddenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cause of the interruption was a great fluttering
of wings from the edge of the clearing and several
herons flapped heavily out of the woods.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s someone in there,” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right you are, my boy, and I propose that we put
an end to this mystery business and find out who it is.
Volunteers for the job.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course everyone was anxious to penetrate the
mysterious cause of the birds’ flight, which they felt
had something to do with the placing of the bottle and
the tapping on the door, and a few minutes later,
heavily armed and ready for any surprise that might
be sprung on them, the little party sallied across the
clearing and into the dark mass of forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had gone perhaps a quarter of a mile or so,
and Ben Stubbs had remarked that they must have
pretty well reached the limits of the island, when there
was a great crashing of the dense undergrowth immediately
in front of them and a human figure, bent almost
double, was seen darting through the brush with
the rapidity of a scared rabbit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop, or we’ll fire,” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the figure kept on running. Frank was in a
quandary. Of course he had not meant to carry out
his intention and the fact that the man kept on running
put him in an awkward position. They could
not kill the man; yet if they did not fire he would
escape from them and it was most essential they should
capture and question him if it could be done.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ben Stubbs raised his rifle and leveled it. Frank
caught his arm and dragged it down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“None of that,” he said sharply, “if we can’t get
him without shooting him we’ll have to let him get
away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ben laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t git excited, shipmate,” he remarked coolly,
“I was only going ter give him a scare. Once more
Ben raised his rifle and just as the fugitive was vanishing
from view sent a bullet whistling over his head
that nicked off several twigs and sent them scattering
in a shower on his neck. With a loud screech of terror
the fleeing figure flopped down and groveled on
the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’se a British subjec’.” he yelled, “don’t do me no
harm, massa, I’m a subjec’ of the King.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get up, you black rascal,” roared Ben, for by this
time they had come up to the groveling figure and saw
that he was even blacker than the redoubtable Pork
Chops, who had run back to camp at top speed as soon
as they had sighted the fugitive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get up,” he went on, “we are United Statesers,
and the king won’t do you no good now. Who are
you and what do you want around our camp?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tremblingly the negro got to his feet. He was a
strange figure. A palpable negro he yet wore the
garb of a Seminole Indian. His shirt, with its tail
flapping outside a pair of buckskin trousers, bright-colored
turban, and buckskin moccasins were the customary
clothes of the tribe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Frank, as this nondescript figure
stood facing them, beads of perspiration streaming
down its face, “what have you got to say for yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Snooping around and putting bottles of dessicated
bugs on our front stoop,” indignantly cried Billy
Barnes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t mean no harm, massa, didn’t really mean
no harm at all. Me berry good ole man. Bahama
nigger I am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what are you doing here, then?” demanded
Ben.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’ shoot me, massa, an’ I tell you eberyt’ing,”
sputtered the captive, terrified at Ben’s ferocious expression.
Put in more intelligible language than
the Bahama negro used his story was this:</p>

<p class='c009'>Suspected unjustly some years before of having
killed the captain of a sponging vessel of which he
was one of the crew he had fled into the Everglades
to avoid lynching. He had fallen into the hands of
a tribe of Seminoles, off on an otter hunt, when he
was almost famished and had been treated by them
with kindness. In fact so well pleased had he been
with his surroundings that he had taken a wife from
the tribe and was now one of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several days before the outposts had brought news
of the approach of the adventurers into the interior
and the Seminoles had at once made preparations to
turn them back. The Bahaman, whose name, by the
way, he confided was “Quatty,” was singled out as
being the best spy they could send inasmuch as he
could speak English and would understand the conversation
of the strangers. He had landed on the
island the afternoon before and when he saw that
one of the party was a black conceived the idea of
working “obeah” on him. He knew that if the
darky was a West Indian, which he suspected, he
would really interpret the ominous nature of the sign.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why are you so anxious to keep us out?”
asked Harry, “we mean no harm to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, dem ign’nant sabages,” grandiloquently
stated Quatty, “has obtained de idea dat you is in
some way connected wid some white men what came
down in the ’glades tree months ago or so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys started eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some white men that came into the ’glades?”
repeated Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, massa,” said Quatty, “dot’s de bery meaning
I intend to convey.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are these white men?” demanded Frank
and Harry in the same breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Long way from here, far in de ’glades. Dem
sabages is werry much scairt of dem,” went on
Quatty, “one time dey go near dere camp and
some man he throw something make noise like de
worl’ he comin’ to an en’ and blow big hole in de
groun’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It must be the men we are after,” exclaimed Frank
tensely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the stuff they threw was Chapinite,” added
Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are they still here?” was Frank’s next question.
He was keenly afraid of receiving a negative answer,
and his voice almost trembled as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sah, dey’s still here shu nuff,” rejoined
Quatty. “We never go near dem since dat day,
but all de time we see smoke and at night dere is red
flames go up from de island where dey camp. We
tink dey debbils for sho’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys were almost wild with excitement. Even
Ben Stubbs’ face lit up at this unexpected good fortune.
It meant that instead of wasting days seeking
the abductors of Lieutenant Chapin and the stealers
of the formula they would be able, if this Bahama
negro could guide them, to go direct to the spot after
they had laid a plan of campaign.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Could you guide us to this place, Quatty?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wid de greates’ of ease,” replied the negro, quite
proud of the impression he had produced, “but what
fo’ yo wan’ to go dere?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without telling him too many details of their mission
Frank outlined their errand to him and, as it
might be important to secure the co-operation of the
Seminoles, he told Quatty to reassure them as to
the object of the intrusion of the adventurers. After
Quatty had been given something substantial for his
trouble, from Frank’s bill-roll, he dived into the forest
with the promise to return that afternoon with the
chief of the tribe. He was positive, he told the boys,
that the tribe would have no objection to their presence
in the Everglades if they really meant to drive
out the men who, as Quatty put it, he and the tribe
believed to be “debbils.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The rest of the morning was spent in getting the
field wireless and its lofty pole in position and joining
the framework of the <em>Golden Eagle II</em>. With
such energy did the boys work that dinner-time was
forgotten and by afternoon things had reached a
stage where the ship was ready for her golden wing
coverings to be laced on. The work of placing the
engine and truing it up would have to be left to the
next day, for even Frank was not sanguine enough
to believe that they could accomplish that difficult
task by night or he would have ordered work to go
on without a let up.</p>

<p class='c009'>True to his promise shortly before sundown Quatty
reappeared at Walrus Camp with a tall dignified-looking
Seminole dressed in the same manner as
himself. The Indian could not talk English but
Quatty acted as interpreter and the conversation
went on swimmingly. The chief, whose name sounded
like O-shi-ho-wi, agreed not to molest the boys if they
pledged their words not to annoy the tribe or try to
spy into their customs. This the boys readily agreed
to and the chief then produced a pipe. After gravely
taking a whiff he handed it to Ben Stubbs whom he
regarded approvingly and Ben in turn, after a puff or
two, handed it to the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lathrop looked at it in disgust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t smoke it,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on,” said Ben, “just a whiff will do. The
Injuns think that if you’ve smoked a pipe with them
you won’t break any promise you have made. If
you won’t you’ll insult them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, if that’s the case, all right,” said Lathrop,
and, with a wry face, he took a pull at the pipe and
then suffered a violent fit of coughing. The others
in their turn took a whiff. The only ones who appeared
to have any relish for it, however, were Ben
Stubbs and Pork Chops, the latter of whom said
patronizingly to Quatty:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah’ve got some good terbaccer in de hause,
nigger, if yo’ wan’ to smoke somethin’ better dan dese
yar shavings.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah consider dat berry good terbaccer, tank you,
sah,” replied Quatty with dignity, “and ah’ll tank
you ter keep any cricketscisms to yo’sef.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a stately gesture the chief signified that
negotiations were at an end as soon as the pipe-smoking
had been concluded. He examined the
framework of the <em>Golden Eagle II</em> with much interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huh-man-bird,” was his comment, “canoe better.
Not so far to fall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There still remained one bit of business to be done
and both Frank and Harry anticipated some little
trouble over it—this was the retention of Quatty as
their guide to the ’glade islet on which the abductors
had set up their plant. The chief consented to his
being retained, but Quatty himself was more doubtful.
The promise of a canoe, however, as well as a
good round sum of money decided him. He would
go. But he wanted to know how the boys meant to
get into the interior of the ’glades. From where they
were at the moment it would take many days of
threading intricate water lanes, he explained, to arrive
at their destination.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a half smile at the explosion he knew was
about due Frank replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but we don’t mean to go by canoe. We shall
travel by air.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The negro turned an actual gray with perturbation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sah,” he exclaimed, “no, sah. Yo won’ go
froo no air wid me. Ah’m too fond of mah life to go
skeedaddlin’ round in de clouds in dat contraption.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All the persuasions the boys could think of were of
no avail. Quatty obstinately refused to reconsider his
determination not to go up in the air-ship. Finally
a happy thought struck Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get one of the rifles,” he whispered to Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy hastened into the hut and reappeared with
a fine automatic. His own in fact.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Quatty,” commanded Frank, “watch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He raised the rifle to his shoulder and pressing the
trigger, fired the whole magazine. He reloaded it
and handed it to the amazed negro.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now you try it,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>A grin of huge delight spread over the black’s face
as the automatic weapon shot out its rain of lead. As
for the chief he stood stock still, but a look of amazement
spread over even his stolid countenance at the
exhibition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what do you think of it?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dat’s de mostest wonderfulest gun I eber seed,”
confessed the darky.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be yours if you guide us to the island where
the ‘debbils’ are,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old darky sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah get de money an’ de canoe as well?” he said
at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Den, massa, I’se you man, fo’ I nebber could
resist a good gun, and,” he added, as though he found
consolation in the thought, “ef I break my neck yo
breaks yohs too.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <br />THE EVERGLADES IN AN AEROPLANE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Hurray, we are in communication with the
<em>Tarantula</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Frank who spoke. Seated at the field wireless
apparatus, with the metallic headpiece about his
ears, he rapidly noted down the reply to the message
he had flashed out some time previously. The message
was signed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Selby,” and read:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Am standing by, off the coast. Communication
perfect. Will keep in touch constantly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank’s message had been a brief outline of his
plans, which were to sail in the <em>Golden Eagle II</em> that
afternoon if feasible, and ascertain the exact location
of the camp of the formula stealers, and leave the rest
of the plan of procedure to such circumstances as
might arise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feverishly working, the boys and their aides got
the <em>Golden Eagle II</em> in shape for flight by noon of
that day. Thanks to the specially prepared engine-bed
that the boys had had constructed, there was little
to do except to bolt the driving machinery in place,
after which but little adjustment was necessary to
true it up with the shafts. While Harry and Lathrop
took up positions at the propellers and the rest of the
party hung onto the winged ship with might and main,
Frank carefully adjusted the engine, having timed it
down to its lowest number of revolutions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” he cried when all was ready.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys gave the propellers a twist. To their delight
the engine worked as smoothly as a sewing machine.
The power was then cut off and the work of
stocking up the lockers beneath the transoms in the
pilot-house begun. It was Frank’s intention that if it
became necessary to settle down anywhere for any
length of time to use the pilot-house as a camping
place. This would save the necessity of a tent and as
every ounce of weight counts in an aeroplane this was
an important consideration. The canvas screens—of
the lightest grade of duck carefully waterproofed—which
have been previously mentioned were provided
for this very purpose as were also mosquito net curtains
for fine weather.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank’s navigating instruments found their place
in a pocket handy to the steersman’s hand. The
compass of course being adjusted in a balanced
socket that kept it always visible to the helmsman.
The operating keys of the <em>Golden Eagle II’s</em> wireless
apparatus were in the rear of the chassis and in the
space beneath its stand was coiled the five hundred
feet of rope through which ran a strand of phosphor
bronze wire which was to be used for grounding the
current. Alongside the reserve gasolene found its
place.</p>

<p class='c009'>The searchlight, swinging easily on a pivot, was
also of course a part of the helmsman’s equipment,
and handy to him was slung his revolver in a big loose
holster. The rifles and ammunition and the stock of
provisions carried went in the lockers, as well as a
waterproof sod-cloth to place beneath the chassis if
camping on wet ground, and a small blue-flame oil-stove
made of aluminum. The few cooking utensils
carried were also of aluminum and nested. The last
thing to go aboard was a folding canvas boat of which
more later.</p>

<p class='c009'>All these preparations concluded, the boys partook
of the last dinner they were to eat in company for
perhaps several days. Over the meal, which Pork
Chops had made quite an elaborate one in celebration
of the occasion, final plans were discussed. Lathrop
was to have charge of the wireless apparatus and at
all hours of the day or night either he, Ben Stubbs
or Billy Barnes was to be on duty beside it on the
watch for calls. The boys would also, it was agreed,
watch their apparatus constantly. Frank’s ingenuity
had provided each machine with an appliance, not
unlike the ordinary telephone bell, which commenced
ringing loudly as soon as any other instrument within
range got “in tune.” This was a patentable improvement,
as an ordinary wireless machine has no
such convenient attachment and only apprises its
operator of a call by a faint click hardly audible to the
unpracticed ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>After lunch the boys went over every rod and wire
of the aeroplane and found her to be in first class
shape. While these preparations were going on
Quatty had been eyeing the craft with the liveliest
indications of fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah’d jes’ as soon ride on de back ob a fish eagle,”
he said apprehensively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Quatty, you’re not going to back out now,
are you?” asked Frank with a smile at the negro’s
trepidation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lord, no, Massa Frank, ah said ah’d go wid yo’
an’ I will, but ef it wasn’ fo’ dat rifle I wouldn’ go not
fo’ nuffin’. Say,” he added suddenly, “could ye jes’
wait a while till I paddle home an’ say goo’-bye to my
wife?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, we can’t,” laughed Frank, ruthlessly cutting
short the black’s hope of even a moment’s reprieve
from going aloft in the object of his terror.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are we all ready, Harry?” he asked the next
minute.</p>

<p class='c009'>The younger boy nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold on a minute,” cried Frank suddenly, “there
is one thing we’ve forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He ran back into the hut and reappeared with
a small object he had fished out of his toilet-bag.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a silken American flag. The boys attached
it to a small pair of halyards at the stern of the chassis
and ran it up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on in with you, Quatty,” cried Harry,
when this was completed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Speechless with terror the negro hobbled up to the
machine and hesitatingly clambered into the chassis.
He sat quivering like a jelly on the floor of the pilot-house
as the boys followed him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you squatting on the floor for?” asked
Harry, laughing, “don’t you want to see the scenery?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah can see all ah wan’ right yar,” was the terrified
darky’s reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a final handclasp the boys followed the negro
into the chassis and Harry took up his place at the
engines and Frank got into the steerman’s narrow
seat. Lathrop and Billy Barnes were at the propellers
ready to give them the twist that would start the
machinery.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let her go,” cried Frank with a backward glance.
Harry bent low over the carburettor and carefully adjusted
it and the lubricating system.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next minute, with a roar like that of a dozen
Gatling guns, the engine started up. Volumes of
blue smoke poured from the exhaust which also shot
out jets of ruddy flame. To anyone not used to the
racket of a powerful engine suddenly turned up to its
full power it was actually terrifying. Quatty writhed
in a paroxysm of terror on the quivering floor of the
pilot-house as the whole fabric of the aeroplane shook
as if it had been convulsed by an earthquake.</p>

<p class='c009'>Like a big ungainly bird it ran rapidly over the
ground for a few dozen yards and then as it gathered
speed under its rapidly revolving propellers, Frank
threw in the top speed clutch and jerked back the lever
that controlled the rising planes. Like a perfectly
trained animal the big air-craft obeyed and rose as
gracefully as a butterfly into the air. For fully ten
minutes, till they were clear of the tree-tops, Frank
kept her rising—the terrified Quatty rolling about on
the inclined floor of the pilot-house like a rubber ball.
Then as she soared safely above all obstructions he
threw her onto an even keel and headed her due
east.</p>

<p class='c009'>Far below them Harry, leaning over the stern,
could see the small clearing in which stood the dead
sailor’s habitation and the rapidly diminishing figures
of Lathrop, Billy, Ben, and Pork Chops waving a
frantic adieu. The darky had in his hand a frying-pan
which he flourished and was evidently shouting,
for he had his hand at his lips, but of course anything
he might have said was at that height inaudible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once on an even keel Frank threw in the mufflers
and throttled the engine down a little so that the uproar
that had so terrified Quatty was diminished.
Occasionally as she struck some contrary air-current
the aeroplane would give a dip that terrified the negro
into fresh convulsions, but otherwise the really alarming
sensation that accompanies the rising into the
upper air of an aeroplane had ceased and they were
driving ahead calmly enough, though not fast, for
there was a stiff northeast wind blowing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Quatty, what do you think of it as far as
you’ve gone?” jestingly asked Harry as, having adjusted
his engines to suit him he sat wiping his hands
on a bit of greasy waste.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah’s jes’ as soon ride on a buckin’ broncho as
on dis yar contraption,” rejoined Quatty, who had by
this time scrambled to his hands and knees, “it’s
eben worser dan I thought.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A diplomatic idea entered Harry’s head. They
would have to get Quatty over his scare before he
would be of any use to them and this necessity gave
rise to Harry’s inspiration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I think you are a very brave man, Quatty,”
he said solemnly; “that Pork Chops is such a coward
that he wouldn’t dare to do what you’ve done.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic003'>

<p>The Boy Aviators set out in the <em>Golden Eagle II</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Is dat so, Massa Harry, fo’ a fac’?” asked
Quatty eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes indeed,” went on Harry seriously, “he’s such
a coward that he would have fainted if we had even
suggested coming up with us to him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’se a berry brave nigger and dat’s a fac’,”
proudly said Quatty rising to the bait, “them no
’count southern niggers ain’t got no real courage no-how.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So well did Harry’s diplomatic admiration work
that before they had been afloat in the upper air for
half an hour more Quatty was seated on one of the
transoms holding onto a strap provided for the purpose
and piloting Frank as the ship forged steadily
along into the wind, her engine running without a
skip or a start.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a marvelous panorama that lay spread out
far below them. Their bird’s-eye view showed them
immediately beneath the floating craft the myriad
green-clad islands of the archipelago threaded by
bands of sparkling blue water. Soaring in the air
about them, but at a respectful distance, and doubtless
marveling at the invader of their realm, were kitty-hawks
and fish-eagles and sometimes even the rare
Everglade kite. If it had not been for the speed they
were going nothing would have pleased Harry better
than to get out a rifle and try a little target practice
at the myriad bird-life that soared beneath and around
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was not so much the immediate scene, beautiful
as it was, that gripped the attention of the voyagers.
Far in front of them lay a broad, dark band of
trees that they knew marked the mainland and was
the thick belt of cypress trees that gives its name to
the Big Cypress Swamp. Beyond this again lay a
scene that made their hearts beat high. It was a vast,
an apparently illimitable stretch of brown prairie,
looking from that distance very much like our western
plains viewed from a mountain top. In the golden
glow of the afternoon it shimmered and shone hazily
like a magic land. Here and there patches of dark
cloud-like blue dotted it and these the boys knew
were the islands that are scattered at more or less
frequent intervals among the watery wastes of the
’glades and on one of which, with a catch of the heart,
they realized lay the object of their long quest.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <br />A NIGHT ALARM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Quatty, quite recovered now from his first terror,
and almost aggressive in his newly-found courage,
sat by Frank’s side directing him as well as he could
for, as he explained, he would not be able to get his
bearings till they had passed the cypress belt and were
above the Everglades themselves. Every now and
again, however, he would give the young captain a
steering direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A bit mo’ eas’ by sout’,” or “Hold a bit to de
sout’ sout’ eas’, massa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are we making, Frank, do you estimate?”
inquired Harry, as the ship rushed through the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“About ten miles,” rejoined the other, “the wind
is dead against us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not as fast as a subway express, but doing pretty
well,” was Harry’s comment.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young engineer was, however, most of the time
as engrossed with his engines as was Frank with the
steering apparatus. From time to time he ran his
hand carefully over them to see if the condenser was
doing its cooling work properly. The lubricating
gear also received his careful attention. A heated
bearing would have meant a serious accident if not
disaster and Harry was too old an aeronaut despite
his youthful years not to pay the closest attention to
one of the most important features of a gasolene
engine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems to me that we had better make camp for
the night in the cypress belt if possible and make an
early start over the ’glades themselves to-morrow,”
said Frank, as the dark line of trees grew gradually
nearer and the boys saw that they formed a thick
belt in some places several miles across.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, if we find a landing-place,” rejoined Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How about that, Quatty?” questioned Frank,
“are there any smooth spots clear of trees in the
swamp?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, berry plenty, massa,” replied the negro. “I
fin’ you nice lilly campin’ place we get near dem.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Like a big hawk about to pounce the <em>Golden Eagle
II</em> was hovering about an hour before sundown above
the tops of the dark cypresses in search of a suitable
spot to swoop down. After Frank had manœuvred
her in widening circles through the air for perhaps
half an hour they at last were above a large clearing
a mile or more in diameter and which was quite clear
of trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Injun make um long time ago, maybe three, four
thousan’ years,” explained Quatty in answer to the
boys’ questions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Three or four hundred, more likely,” laughed
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or three or four,” added Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Berry well, massas,” said Quatty, highly offended,
“I ’spose ah don’ know nuffin’ but what an ig’nant
sabage knows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To make a landing Frank swung the aeroplane in a
long descending arc till he was a few feet above the
tops of the outermost of the trees that fringed the
clearing then he raised the planes slightly and the
<em>Golden Eagle II</em> glided to the earth in a long, slow
sweep. The engines had of course been cut out as the
descent began and she settled as easily as a bird
alighting.</p>

<p class='c009'>With mosquito netting brought for the purpose the
sides of the pilot-house were at once enclosed, for
although it was still daylight, the tiny pests that make
life miserable on the edges of the ’glades had begun
to appear in armies. Strange to say, in the ’glades
themselves there are hardly any mosquitoes, but on
its borders they swarm in great numbers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Quatty built a smudge of green wood and leaves
before he set about getting supper and in this way the
worst of the visitation was alleviated.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys watched with some interest while Quatty
built his fire. He had lived so long with the Seminoles
that he built it in the way the Indians have adopted
from time immemorial. First he made a big ring of
dry sticks and twigs, the largest on the outside and
the small dry ones in the center. He lighted it in the
center with his old flint and steel and then having
made a rack out of a stick of green wood, placed
across two forked upright ones, he pushed the larger
timbers from the outside to the center as occasion required.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a hearty meal of stewed preserved meat made
into a delectable stew with dessicated vegetables and
canned corn, followed by stewed evaporated fruit
washed down by boiling tea, the boys and Quatty
retired to the mosquito-barred pilot-house of the
<em>Golden Eagle II</em>, where Quatty lighted his pipe “jes’
ter plague dem mosquitoes outside,” he explained,
and the boys talked over future plans. After a short
time, however, weariness after the energetic day they
had put in completely overcame them and they
stretched out on the transoms. In a few minutes
sleep closed their eyes and the only sound that disturbed
the deep silence in the cypress belt was the
loud snoring of Quatty and the rhythmical croaking of
the frogs and tree lizards in the swamp.</p>

<p class='c009'>Toward midnight Frank could not judge how long
he had been asleep, it seemed to him five minutes, as
a matter of fact it was as many hours, when he was
awakened with a start to hear a stealthy tread a few
feet away from the aeroplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s there?” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c009'>The minute his voice rang out the footsteps retreated
as stealthily as they had approached.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this lonely untraveled spot who could it be?</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy awakened his brother and Quatty and
cautioning them to silence whispered them his alarming
intelligence. Each boy grabbed his rifle and prepared
to defend the <em>Golden Eagle II</em> with all their
power. As for that arrant coward Quatty, all his recent
bravado quite gone, he could only tremble and
whimper in terror.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you suppose it is, Frank?” whispered
Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish I knew,” replied the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think it’s Indians?” was Harry’s next
question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It might be,” replied Frank, “but I’m afraid that
it’s worse than that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” inquired Harry in the same
low tone of voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That the men we are in pursuit of have got some
inkling of our purpose and are even now lurking
about here to wreck the aeroplane and perhaps kill
us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The prospect was certainly an alarming one. If
Frank’s idea was correct they were powerless. It
was unlikely that their enemies would be less than
half a dozen and perhaps more. Brave as they were
the two boys realized that they could do little against
such overwhelming numbers and Quatty was worse
than useless.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here he comes again,” cried Frank in a tense
whisper as after several minutes of silence the boys
sat gripping their rifles.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sure enough the slow, heavy tread was again advancing.
It was too dark in the shadows of the
mighty cypress trees to see anything and the boys
could only judge of the enemy’s whereabouts by the
sound. After advancing quite close to the aeroplane
the steps ceased and the boys could distinctly hear a
low, steady breathing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t stand this any longer,” whispered Frank.
“I’m going to fire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aiming directly at the sound Frank pulled the
trigger. As the report crashed among the trees a roar
of pain filled the air and a crashing sound as if a body
had fallen was heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What on earth is it?” gasped Harry, as the roar
was followed by whines and yells of pain and a sound
as if a big carcass was lashing about on the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Quatty who solved the mystery.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, dat’s a panfer,” he cried, “ah knowed all
along ’twern’t nuffin’ but dat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get the lantern,” ordered Frank, curtly, “and
we’ll see what it is.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic004'>
<a href='images/illus-200.jpg'><img src='images/illus-200.jpg' alt='' class='ig004' /></a>
<p>Frank shoots a panther.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, massa,” sputtered the negro awed by the
boy’s sharp tone. He lit the lamp in silence and the
boys sallied out. It was as Quatty had said. On the
ground near their camp-fire lay the animal still writhing.
Frank put it out of its agony with a shot through
the head and then the boys bent over their prize, examining
admiringly its tawny skin and great shapely
head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See, massa, Quatty was right. Nuffin’ to get
scared of. Nuffin’ but an ole panfer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you think it was ‘nuffin’ but a panfer’ ten
minutes ago?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, no, massa,” replied the darky, somewhat
abashed; “but ah ’spected it right along. Yes, sah,
ah mus’ say ah ’spected ’twan’t nuffin’ but dat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time the sky to the east across the Everglades
was beginning to grow gray and as none of the
party felt any more inclination to sleep, Quatty was
set to work to skin the panther; after which Frank
and Harry sauntered into the woods with the shotguns.
So good was their success that they managed
to bag three brace of doves which broiled with strips
of bacon formed a very agreeable addition to the oatmeal,
pilot-bread and coffee on which they had intended
making their morning meal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even before they had despatched their breakfast the
sun had risen and illuminated the vast brown levels
of the ’glades, which now lay directly before them.
The sky was specked with kites and vultures attracted
by the carcass of the panther.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dey won’t even leab’ any pickins ob him,” said
Quatty, motioning up at the soaring carrion birds,
“’specs dey finks we pretty good folks to gib dem
brakfus’ as well as ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Breakfast despatched and the engine fed with fresh
lubricant and the gasolene and condenser tanks filled
with additional fuel and water the young adventurers
were ready to take up what they felt was to
be the most important stage of their journey thus
far.</p>

<p class='c009'>The machine was hauled back from the part of the
glade where it had alighted to the extreme far side
so as to give it all the room possible to rise in. There
being no one to turn the propellers the boys utilized
their self-starting apparatus.</p>

<p class='c009'>This consisted of a handle attached to a cogged
wheel which operated a chain which in turn revolved
another cogged wheel connected to both shafts. This
of course acted in exactly the same way as if some
one had twisted the propellers, but it required more
elbow grease. After a couple of revolutions the engine
started up and with a quick all-seeing glance fore
and aft Frank threw in the clutch. The <em>Golden Eagle
II</em> started as easily as she had the day before and took
the air after about fifty yards’ run.</p>

<p class='c009'>A serious accident, however, was narrowly averted
as she cleared the tree-tops. Quatty, arrogant in the
fact that he no longer feared the riding in an aeroplane,
was standing carelessly on the inclined floor as
the craft rose. A sudden jerk as she bucked an uprising
current almost threw him from his feet and he
made a grab for the first thing he could catch hold
of, which was a starboard rudder wire. Under the
tug of the stumbling negro’s hand the rudder was
of course pulled over and the ship gave a dizzy
swoop.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry at the engine was thrown right across the
pilot-house and Frank thought for a minute that they
had gone. With a swift glance he saw what had happened.
Reaching back he caught the luckless Quatty
a blow under the jaw that laid him flat and effectually
loosened his hold on the tiller-wire. Swift as thought
the young captain skilfully righted her but not before
her port wing-tip had grazed the topmost foliage of
one of the loftier cypresses.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they were once more safe Frank spoke:</p>

<p class='c009'>“In future, Quatty,” he said, “you will lie flat on
the floor when we are going up.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br />ON THE MOUND-BUILDERS’ ISLAND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>His high spirits considerably dashed by his misadventure,
Quatty sat soberly enough on the transom
till Frank ordered him forward to give the young
captain sailing directions. They were now racing
through the air above the Everglades themselves.
Everywhere below them spread the yellowish brown
expanse of saw-grass and water-course with here and
there a clump of cabbage-palms marking an occasional
dry spot. Far on the horizon, like a blue
cloud, rested the nearest of the islets on one of which
lay their goal. Beyond it like other cloud fragments,
lay dim in the distance other patches of elevated
land.</p>

<p class='c009'>Save for the bird-life they could see about them
there was no signs of animate existence beneath the
aeroplane. Not even a canoe threaded any of the
numerous water-courses that spread like a net over
the ’glades. A more doleful scene could hardly be
imagined.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did these men ever find their way to the
interior?” wondered Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dey must have had a guide, massa,” replied
Quatty promptly, “nobody dat don’ know de ’glades
can find him way in dem.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where could they get such a guide?” questioned
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Plenty ob dem,” replied Quatty, “plenty ob Injuns
take ’em whereber dey want.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you said your tribe was opposed to them?”
objected Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’ know nuffin’ ’bout ‘suppose to dem,’ Massa
Harry; but dere ubber tribes in de ’glades dan ours.
Some ob dem don’ lak us neider.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you think they secured guides from some
other tribe?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mus’ ab,” rejoined Quatty, “none of my fren’s
would guide dem.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The nearest island rapidly assumed shape and
resolved itself into a charming bower of tropical
vegetation rising at its highest point about forty or
fifty feet above the monotonous level of the ’glades
As it grew nearer the boys were astonished to see
that its summit was bare of trees and formed a plateau
of some area which was flat as the top of a table.
It was as if some giant had lopped off the top of it
with a huge knife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s very extraordinary,” said Frank, as they
gazed at it, “one would almost say that it had been
formed artificially.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The air-ship circled about the islet under Frank’s
skilled control while the youthful aerial navigators
scanned it with eager eyes. They could now plainly
perceive that in the center of the flat top a sort of
altar, about seven feet long by four feet high, had
been erected.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A sacrificial altar of some ancient tribe,” cried
Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not so sure,” replied Frank as the <em>Golden
Eagle II</em> heeling over, circled slowly about the object
of their mystification. “What do you know about
this, Quatty?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quatty thinks him used by Injuns to make smoke
signals,” said the old negro scanning the altar narrowly.
“When an Injun he wants to signal he builds
a fire on dere and den makes de smoke rise or fade
away by covering it wid a green branch,” he further
explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is undoubtedly the correct explanation,”
said Frank, “of course there was an ancient race of
mound-builders in Florida and this may be one of
their mounds, but I have never read that they had any
sacrificial rites. As Quatty says, the Seminoles must
have used this old mound-builders’ hill, which the
aborigines may have utilized as a fort, or as a convenient
place for signaling from.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He headed the aeroplane on her course again after
this explanation and the adventurers had proceeded
perhaps a mile through the air when Quatty who,
with his hand shading his eyes, had been searching
the horizon, suddenly cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hol’ on der, Massa Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter?” asked the boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See dar. Ef dat ain’t smoke ’way off dere call
me an ignerent sabage!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He pointed to a small islet a couple of points to the
southward of the course on which they were heading.
The boys’ gaze followed his pointing finger. Their
eyes, not so keen as the wilderness dweller’s, however,
could perceive nothing but a small blue eminence
of land not in any way different from several other
similar ones dotted along the horizon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’ you see smoke ober dere?” asked Quatty,
wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” cried both boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lordy, lordy, you eyes are dim as bats’ fo’ sho’.”
cried the negro shaking his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank reached into the pocket in which the glasses
were kept. With their powerful lenses he swept the
horizon. He confirmed the correctness of Quatty’s
eyesight the next minute.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the nebulous mass,—which seen through the
glasses proved to be an islet very like the one over
which they had just passed—a column of smoke was
certainly rising.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It may be Indians,” said Harry, after he too had
taken a long look.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Injuns,” snorted old Quatty, “dems no Injuns.
Dat ain’t de color ob Injuns’ smoke. Ah knows whar
ah is now ah do—dat’s de place where dose men
you come all dis way ter look foh makes de debbil
stuff dat blows de holes in de ground.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A hasty consultation between the boys followed.
At the distance they then were from the islet it was
unlikely that their presence in the air had been noted.
It would be useless to keep on in broad daylight as
their usefulness might end as soon as the plotters
discovered their presence and knew their plant had
been discovered. On all accounts it seemed best to
camp on the mound-builders’ island for the night and
wireless to Camp Walrus their views.</p>

<p class='c009'>Accordingly the aeroplane was put about and a
short time after was resting on the summit of the
mound-builders’ hill. The boys were far from satisfied
with the location but there was no other available
landing-place and they decided to run the risk of
being sighted before dark.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wireless apparatus was at once put in order for
the transmission of messages and Frank started to
call Camp Walrus. Again and again the spark leaped
crackling across the gap,—transmitting the call of
C-W, C-W, C-W,—before an answer came.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything, it seemed, was going on well at the
camp and they had heard that morning from the
<em>Tarantula</em>. The destroyer was cruising about the
archipelago awaiting news of the success or failure
of the boys’ expedition and Frank, as he was doubtful
of being able to “pick up” the vessel at the
distance inland they then were, asked Lathrop to transmit
to Lieutenant Selby the news that they had discovered
the hiding-place of the plotters and would
inform him of their next move when they made it.
The instrument was then cut out and the usual preparations
for making camp gone about, with Quatty’s
assistance.</p>

<p class='c009'>This done the boys, guns in hand, started to explore
the mound on which they found themselves. A
steep path, apparently well trodden once but now overgrown
with creepers and weeds, led to its base. There
was nothing else remarkable about it, except, as has
been said, its bald summit. It swarmed with game,
however, and several doves, quail and rabbits fell to
the boys’ guns during the afternoon. Quatty cooked
the game deliciously in an oven of his own invention.
He first dug a hole which he lined with stones, heated
almost red hot in a fire previously prepared. This
done he lined it again with green stuff and covered
the whole with leaves and branches. Then he covered
in the entire oven with more leaves and tapped
them off with earth at the top to enable it to retain
the heat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now we leab ole Muvver Erf to do our cookin’,”
he remarked when he had completed these preparations.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next task to occupy the boys’ attention was the
setting up of the canvas boat. The craft was a large
pea-pod shaped pocket of the strongest grade of
brown duck, which was stretched into boat form by
steel spreaders and held rigidly in shape by locking
clamps. It was a boat eminently fitted to navigate
the Everglades, where there are no sharp rocks or
rapid waters to be encountered, though hardly suited
for more strenuous work. It was about twenty feet
in length and capable of carrying five hundred pounds.
The boys carried the compact bundle in which it was
packed to the water’s edge and put it together there.
When afloat on the water it looked not unlike a big,
brown pumpkin seed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now where’s de poles?” asked Quatty, looking
about him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poles? What for? We’ve got paddles for it,”
said Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Paddles not much good in de ’glades, Massa
Harry,” replied Quatty, “we need poles to git ober de
groun’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After some hunting among the dense undergrowth
Quatty finally found two straight sticks of tough
second growth timber, about fifteen feet long, that
satisfied him. He cut these off with his heavy sailor’s
knife with the remark:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Soon we hab two berry good canoe poles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He whittled both sticks to a sharp point at one end
and then cut two triangular bits of wood from another
tree which he affixed with vine lashings to the
poles about six inches from the bottom. The contrivance
was exactly like the steps that are affixed to
stilts but there were two of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you putting those on for?” asked the
boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Plenty ob mud in de ’glades sometimes,” replied
Quatty, “dese lilly steps keeps de poles from diggin’
in too deep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Quatty, you are a genius,” exclaimed
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh dese not my inwention, Massa Frank,” modestly
confessed Quatty. “Seminoles use him many,
many years befo’ Quatty come here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys had decided on a daring plan. It was
nothing less than, as soon as the night fell, to pole
and paddle their way through the water-courses till
they reached a spot near the camp of the kidnappers of
Lieutenant Chapin and there reconnoiter and, if
possible, overhear enough to give them a clue to the
lieutenant’s whereabouts. Their first object being of
course to rescue him. The recovery of the formula
of his invention was—though important in the extreme—a
secondary consideration.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a hasty supper everything about the camp was
put in order and with their revolvers freshly oiled
and plenty of ammunition in their pockets the adventurers
descended by the mound-builders’ path to
where they had moored the canvas boat. Quatty accompanied
them. He put on a great assumption of
bravery but inwardly he was quaking till his teeth
chattered. Still he decided in his own mind he would
rather a thousand times accompany the boys—however
dangerous their errand—than spend the night
alone in a spot which he firmly believed was haunted
by the ghosts of the ancient tribesmen who had
erected it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last thing Frank did before leaving was to call
up Camp Walrus on the wireless. He bade his young
friends and companions there a hearty “good-bye”
and received their aerial “good-luck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the night noises of the jungle began to arise, and
the evening chill of the ’glades crept over the lower
levels like a cold pall, the boys shoved off and under
Quatty’s guidance began to pole toward the southeast.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c007'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <br />CAPTAIN BELLMAN’S ISLAND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Silently, as some craft propelled by spirits, they
glided along between the high walls of saw-grass
that grew up on each side of the stream they were
navigating. Quatty stood in the stern manipulating
the pole with the skill of a very Seminole, and sending
the light craft through the water at a surprising rate
of speed. His elevated position gave him a chance
to peer over the tops of the lower clumps of saw-grass
and judge—by their glitter under the starlight—which
leads were the best to follow.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was pitchy dark, with the exception of the dim
starlight, and to the boys it seemed that they were
passing through an endless tunnel. They threaded in
and out of creeks till it seemed that they must be progressing
in a circle. But Quatty, whatever his other
faults might be, knew the Everglades as a city dweller
knows his own streets, and by the darker landmarks
of various hammocks and islets he steered the craft as
unerringly as a cab-driver who wishes to drive in a
certain direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Occasionally as they brushed against a sunken log,
or shoal of rank-smelling mud, there would be a heavy
flop in the water or a rustling sound in the dry grass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whatever is that, Quatty?” asked Harry after
the sound had been several times repeated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Moccasins. Dey bite you, you die plenty quick,”
responded Quatty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry, who had been trailing his hand in the water,
quickly drew it in, not without a shudder. He had
seen cotton-mouth moccasins before and had a lively
recollection of the fat, dirty colored reptiles and their
deadly fangs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once, as they were crossing quite a broad sheet of
water that suddenly opened out about them, something
bumped up under the boat with such violence
that Quatty was almost upset from his position astern.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good gracious, was that an earthquake?” exclaimed
Harry much alarmed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Gator,” grunted Quatty, “ah’d jes like to stop
an’ git his ugly hide fo’ dat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’ll be no shooting to-night, let’s hope,” was
Frank’s reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>They poled along in silence after this. The boys
were completely bewildered and had no more idea of
where they were going than if they had been blindfolded.
But Quatty never stopped poling and fell to
his work with such an air of certainty that the boys
were compelled to conclude that he knew what he was
about.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly the negro uttered a sharp grunt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” asked Frank instantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look ober dere, massa, an’ tell me wad you see,”
said Quatty, pointing dead ahead.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the risk of upsetting the boat and himself Frank
stood up and saw reflected on the sky, not more than
a mile ahead, a deep-red glow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fire,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, an’ it’s de furnaces dem debbils has built dere
fo’ make dere blow up stuff, drat ’em,” was Quatty’s
response.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were then at last within sighting distance of
the mysterious forces that had succeeded in filching
the formula of the United States’ most deadly explosive
and kidnapping one of the bravest and most popular
young officers in the Navy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pole ahead, till I tell you to stop,” commanded
Frank, resuming his seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“W-w-w-what,” stuttered Quatty, “yo’ goin’ on,
Marse Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly,” was the quiet reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“B-b-b-but we may git shot or blowed up wid de
debbil powder,” protested the frightened black.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will certainly get shot if you don’t obey commands,”
was Frank’s stern rejoinder, “pole ahead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Something in the young leader’s voice, decided
Quatty that it was best to obey and with chattering
teeth he started the canoe moving nearer and nearer to
the red glow. As they approached its source, the light
it cast grew brighter and the boys were enabled to see
each other’s faces.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop,” commanded Frank suddenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Quatty breathed a sigh of relief. Perhaps now they
were going to go back. But no. After a few seconds’
reconnoitering, Frank gave the order to go ahead and
the trembling Quatty, with his eyes on the boys gleaming
revolver, obeyed. Frank stood up in the boat
when he took his brief survey without much fear of
being seen by the men on the island, as in the bright
light shed by the furnaces with which they were
manufacturing the explosive they would hardly be able to
penetrate the surrounding blackness.</p>

<p class='c009'>What he had seen was this: A large barn-like
building erected against the side of a hill surrounded
by smaller huts and out in the open, removed at some
distance from the other buildings, a large, retort-shaped
blast furnace, from the mouth of which was
pouring a column of copper-colored flame and a great
efflorescence of sparks. It was this furnace doubtless
that had caused the column of smoke they had seen
during the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the bright light cast by the flaming mouth of the
retort he could see dark figures scurrying around,
some of them with wheelbarrows which they pushed
up an inclined plane leading to the side of the retort.
From their barrows they constantly dumped something
into the furnace. What it could be of course Frank
had no means of knowing, but he guessed that it was
some substance used in the manufacture of Chapinite.
The whole scene reminded Frank of one of the foundries
in the iron district, seen from a car window at
night.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the aid of the night-glasses he could make out
details more plainly. The workmen were being urged
to even greater activity by a tall man who was evidently
in authority. From time to time this man
raised a whip he held in his hand and brought its lash
down viciously on the back of some unfortunate
worker with a crack that was audible even at the distance
the boys were.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh Lawd, dat look like Hades for sho’!” groaned
Quatty as his eyes almost popped out of his head at
the weird scene. “Dem not men, Massa Frank, dems
all debbils.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pole her along a bit!” ordered Frank, not paying
any attention to this outburst. He was bent on getting
near enough to ascertain, if possible, if the unfortunate
Lieutenant Chapin was one of the crew of
laborers.</p>

<p class='c009'>With frequent orders to stop from Frank which
were obeyed by Quatty with alacrity and commands
to proceed once more, which did not meet with the
same eager response, the boat drew nearer and nearer
to the blazing retort and the frenzied workers. As
they were still in between high banks of saw-grass
the boys had no fear of being seen unless of course
some canoe from the island happened to come down
the stream they were threading. As it was a narrow
twisting, little runnel, however, with barely a foot of
water under their keel, this did not seem likely.</p>

<p class='c009'>All at once, however, they emerged without warning
into a broad smooth-flowing channel worthy of the
name of a river. The boys saw at once that this was
indeed a main-traveled water-course and most probably
the one used by the men on the island in getting
to and from the coast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get back where we were as quick as you can,”
sharply ordered Frank as they glided out onto its
broad current.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a dexterous twist Quatty—quite as much
alarmed as the boys at the prospect of discovery by
the workers on the island—shot the boat back into the
narrow grass-walled creek they had been traversing.
It was well they had done so, for hardly had they
gained the welcome shelter of the tall saw-grass when
they heard the rapid “dip-dip” of paddles coming
toward them down the main channel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep perfectly quiet,” ordered Frank, and scarcely
breathing the boys listened with straining ears to catch
the conversation the men in the approaching craft were
carrying on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurry there, you miserable Indian, or I’ll fill you
full of lead,” were the first words they heard in a
harsh, rough voice. The command was evidently
addressed to the Indian paddler for they heard the reply:</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. Me hurry all I can,” and a quicker dip
of the paddle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a rough fellow, my dear Scudder,” another
voice commented, “are you never in a softer
mood?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not me, Foyashi;” came the reply, “and if you’d
been working for Captain Mortimer Bellman as long
as I have you wouldn’t be either. He learned his
lesson in your government I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Captain Bellman is a remarkable man.” went on
the other speaker, whose accent was distinctly foreign
and mincing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Remarkable? You may lay your head on that,”
replied the other; “nobody but a remarkable man
would have got Chapin to visit him in his hotel and
there drug him and get from him the keys of the safe
where the formula was kept.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did he induce him to visit him?” asked
Foyashi.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, they were classmates at Annapolis before
Bellman was kicked out of the navy for conduct unbecoming
an officer. Chapin’s a good-hearted chap
and when Bellman turned up in Washington one day
and sent him a message that he was ill and in trouble
Chapin came to the hotel like a bird dog when you
whistle it to heel. But you deserve a lot of credit for
your part of the business, Foyashi,” he went on.
“How did you get the lieutenant under your control.
He swore he’d die before he told us the method of
making Chapinite when we first got him aboard the
Mist.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha, ha!” laughed the man, addressed as Foyashi,
“to the Jiu Jitsu expert many nerves are common
knowledge that you foolish Americans do not know
anything about. A little pressure on the nerve I had
selected while the lieutenant slept; and I had dulled
his brain till he did as we directed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wonderful,” exclaimed Scudder admiringly, “I
wish I knew the trick.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope I may never find it necessary to practice on
you,” was the reply of the other, uttered in a tone of
voice that made Harry feel, as he said afterward, as
if he had touched the back of a moccasin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are your plans?” continued Scudder, who
was evidently an inferior in command to Foyashi and
the man spoken of as Captain Bellman, “here you
start me off in the dark in a canoe with enough
Chapinite to blow half the Everglades sky high and you
don’t even tell me where we are taking it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know as well as I do,” replied the other,
“that we are bound for the coast and that we are
going to put the last consignment aboard the submarine
to-night at the mouth of the Jew-Fish river. What
follows to-morrow will be simply the tapping of the
furnace taken to-night and we will work that up into
Chapinite in the government’s yards at home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we are through here,” commented Scudder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Practically, yes. We shall meet the cruiser in the
South Atlantic next week and then sail for home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The cruiser!” exclaimed Scudder, “ain’t you
afraid of the United States government being suspicious?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear friend,” replied the other, “the wisdom
of the Oriental has been left out of your composition.
The cruiser, as I call her, has been converted into the
likeness of a peaceful passenger ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where do you coal her?” demanded Scudder, a
certain admiration in his tones.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys were unable to catch the reply. Indeed
they could not have heard as much of the conversation
as they did had not the small creek fortunately run
parallel with the larger water-course for some distance.
By dint of shoving along the banks with their
hands the boys had managed to keep a short distance
in the rear of the other canoe. Her speed, however,
prohibited their keeping up with her and they were
compelled to satisfy themselves with what they had
already heard, which, however, was of sufficient importance
to cause them to order Quatty to pole back
at top speed to the mound-builders’ island.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was evident from the conversation they had been
lucky enough to overhear that the stealers of the formula,
headed by Captain Mortimer Bellman, were to
leave the ’glades the next day. That the plotters had
a submarine and that it lay at the mouth of the Jew-Fish
river. Furthermore a cruiser, belonging to the
power whose agents the men were, was waiting to
pick them up and carry them back to their own country
and that Lieutenant Chapin had been subjected
to a cruel operation in order to force him to submit to
a betrayal of his country.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a time to act quickly. There was in fact not
a moment to spare.</p>

<p class='c009'>They arrived at the camp on the mound-builders’
island shortly before dawn. A hasty survey with a
lantern indicated, to their great satisfaction, that
nothing had been disturbed and that everything was
as they had left it. From the height of the summit
nothing was visible now of the red glow of the blast
furnace, which indicated to the boys that the plotters
had concluded their work and that the blast had been
extinguished forever. Satisfactory as their night’s
work had been in one respect, however, it had been a
dire failure in another and so the boys could not help
admitting to each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had learned a pretty good outline of the plans
of Captain Bellman and Foyashi, but they had not
gained a single bit of information about Lieutenant
Chapin that would aid them in any way in rescuing
him from what was likely to prove imminent death.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br />A BOLD DASH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Frank’s first action was to bend over the wireless
apparatus and send flashing and crackling across the
air a message to Camp Walrus to be relayed in haste
to the <em>Tarantula</em>. The members of the young adventurers’
party left at the camp were to remain there,
ordered Frank, till the <em>Golden Eagle II</em> returned.
Lathrop was instructed to inform the <em>Tarantula</em> of
the whereabouts of the submarine so that Lieutenant
Selby might head her off in case the boys were unsuccessful
in the quest for the missing naval officer
which Frank felt bound to prosecute, even at the risk
of letting the formula of the explosive get out of the
country.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will do as instructed. Gee! but you are all right,”
was Lathrop’s admiring response, which made both
boys smile in spite of themselves and their heavy
hearts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you propose to do now?” asked Harry,
as Frank cut out the circuit from the wireless and
turned away from the instrument.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go back there as soon as we have had breakfast
and make another try,” was the young leader’s instant
response.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go back?” echoed Harry in amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must,” said Frank earnestly, “a man’s life
may depend on how quickly we act.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But do you think there is any likelihood of our
succeeding in getting near enough to their camp to
aid Lieutenant Chapin materially,” persisted the
younger brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know yet, but I have an idea that by landing
on the other side of the island we might come up
overland behind the settlement we saw last night and
gain some idea of what has become of Lieutenant
Chapin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By George, Frank, you are a wonder,” said
Harry, admiringly. “You are right,” he went on,
“there is a chance and we’ll take it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I knew you’d say so, old fellow,” responded
Frank, warmly grasping his brother’s hand, “and
now for breakfast. It may be the last we’ll get for
some time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Both boys fell to with hearty appetites on wild
guava, avocado pears, broiled doves and two cups a
piece of Quatty’s coffee, which he made with the skill
of a French chef.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I feel ready to tackle a regiment,” declared Harry
as the last morsels disappeared.</p>

<p class='c009'>So far Quatty had had no idea of the plan on foot
and when he did hear it he set up a series of loud
lamentations that could be heard a mile. It was all in
vain, however. Remorselessly Frank ordered him
down to the boat with his pole. Had either of the
boys been expert in the handling of a boat with this
oar of the ’glades they would not have compelled the
badly-scared black to accompany them, but it is an art
which is only acquired by long practice and it was absolutely
necessary that they have the benefit of his expertness.
In the event, that even were the worst to
happen, and they were to be themselves captured, it
was not likely that any harm would come to Quatty;
so neither of their consciences hurt them much as
Quatty shoved off and they once more glided down
the narrow water-course they had threaded the night
before.</p>

<p class='c009'>By daylight their progress was more rapid than it
had been in the darkness of the previous night, and it
was not long before they gained the point at which
the narrow stream they were threading branched
into the broad main water-course. Of course it was
not a feasible idea to follow this and after some
searching they managed to find a tiny, shallow runnel
that proceeded through the saw-grass in the direction
they wished to go but was small enough not to render
it probable that it was a main traveled stream. To
their great disappointment, however, this canoe path
came to an end altogether after they had reached a
point about opposite the trees that abutted on the plotters’
settlement at the easterly end of their collection
of huts. It continued on through the saw-grass, however,
in the form of a muddy Indian trail and the
boys, after a short consultation, decided to leave the
boat behind in Quatty’s charge and take to the
trail.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rifles in hand and revolvers on their hips, they
struggled bravely along through the mud, that sometimes
came up to their knees and sometimes only to
their ankles. It was killing work, for as the sun
worked higher the heat grew almost intolerable. Innumerable
varieties of small stinging insects too,
settled about them in swarms and added to their discomfort.</p>

<p class='c009'>From time to time, in addition, a fat cotton-mouth
would wiggle across the trail or occasionally open
its mouth in a loud hiss, showing the white fangs that
give it its name. Frank killed one of these reptiles
with the butt of his rifle. The others they had to
avoid as best they could. Of course they did not
dare to discharge one of their weapons. To have done
so would have brought the whole settlement about
their ears.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank consulted his pocket compass from time to
time, having taken the general bearing of the island
from the boat before they started. The compass was
the only means they had of knowing if they were following
a correct course, as the saw-grass was so high
on either side of the narrow trail that to see over it
was an impossible feat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Phew!” whispered Harry, as they floundered
along through the wet, steamy earth, “I’ve been in
warm places but this is certainly the hottest of them
all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We cannot have much further to go,” replied
Frank, encouragingly, “as far as I could judge when
we left the boat the island was about two miles
away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I feel as if we’d traveled ten at least,” gasped
poor Harry. “Hark!”</p>

<p class='c009'>His exclamation was called forth by a rustling in
the tall grass directly ahead of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get ready for trouble,” whispered Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both boys got out their revolvers, as being handier
weapons at close quarters than the rifles. The trail
took an abrupt turn just beyond the point at which
they stood, so that it was impossible to see who or
what it was that was approaching.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rustling grew steadily nearer and both boys,
while their hearts beat thickly, determined that if the
persons coming down the path were foemen, to sell
their lives dearly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next minute they had a great surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Round the curve in the trail swung two of the beautiful
small Everglade deer. It was a question which
was the most astonished, the boys or the deer, at the
encounter. For a fraction of a second the deer stood
gazing with their big, liquid eyes, at the boys and the
boys stared back at the deer. Then, as the boys broke
into a smothered laugh at their needless anxiety, the
two animals swung round and galloped back the way
they had come.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we are getting as nervous as a pair of kittens,”
laughed Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They made as much noise as a regiment,” replied
Harry, echoing the other’s merriment, “I always
understood that the deer was a quiet retiring animal.
Now I know different.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At all events our encounter with them proves one
valuable piece of information,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?” demanded his brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That what we had supposed was an island must
in reality be joined to this trail by solid land.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you make that out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, those deer wouldn’t go into the saw-grass,
the stuff cuts like a knife. Therefore they didn’t get
to the trail that way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And their coats were not wet. I notice, therefore,
they had not swum any creek to get here. All
of which goes to show to my mind that if we follow
this trail we will get dry-shod to the island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dry-shod?” echoed Harry, pointing to his muddied
legs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mean that we shall not, as I began to fear, have
to swim any creeks or wade runnels to gain it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was as Frank had assumed. A few minutes more
tramping through the sticky black ooze brought them
to a point where the trail widened, and they could see
beyond the tops of the cabbage palms that fringed
the edge of the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are here at last,” whispered Frank, “now
we shall have to go very carefully till we find out the
lay of the land. There’s no use walking into a trap
for the lack of a little caution.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Slowly the boys crept on down the short section
of trail now remaining. Frank carefully noted
the comparatively dry ground—where the marks of
the deers’ hoofs still showed—that there were no
human tracks visible and this was in itself a good sign
as it showed that the trail was a little used one.</p>

<p class='c009'>They emerged at length into a thickly-grown cabbage
palm patch, through which, to their great delight,
flowed a tiny stream, from one of the clear springs
that abound on the islands of the Everglades. Lying
flat on their faces the boys fairly sucked up the cool,
clear water and let it trickle gratefully down their
parched throats.</p>

<p class='c009'>Greatly refreshed by their draught, they looked
about them. The little grove in which they stood
was surrounded by dense undergrowth. At first
there seemed to be no path through the tangle, but
after a lengthy search the boys discovered a narrow
trail, evidently a continuation of the one they had
just left. It led, as Frank’s compass showed, in the
general direction of the settlement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve come so far we’ve got to go ahead now,”
were Frank’s words, as the two young adventurers
plunged into the dense brush down the narrow trail.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <br />BEN STUBBS DISAPPEARS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Left behind at Camp Walrus, Billy Barnes,
Lathrop, and Ben Stubbs watched the <em>Golden Eagle
II</em> until she became a bird-like speck against the intense
blue of the Florida sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good luck to them,” cried Billy, a wish that was
echoed by all the “stay-at-homes,” as Lathrop had
dubbed them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, Lathrop,” said Billy, the second morning
after the aeroplane faded from view, “let’s get
the guns and go for a hunt. I’m sure I heard a wild
turkey in the brush yonder a while ago, and Ben
can mount guard over the wireless while we are
gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think that will be all right?” questioned
Lathrop dubiously, “you know I’m the only one in the
camp that can operate the instrument and I think I
ought to keep within reach of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re right,” rejoined Billy. “It will be better
for Ben and I to go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ben agreed with alacrity, the old prospector was
never better pleased than when there was an opportunity
to hunt, and he hastened to oil up his gun and
fill his cartridge belt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold on a minute,” said Ben, as he and Billy
Barnes started out, “I’m too old a woodsman to go
into the woods without agreeing on a signal if anything
happens. We’ll use the old hunter’s warning.
If we need you, Lathrop, or you need us, we are to
fire first one shot then a pause and then two shots in
rapid succession and keep it up till we get an answer.
We’ll be back to dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” replied Lathrop, “though I don’t see
just what trouble you can get into here, and as for me,
I am all right I guess—so long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Left alone Lathrop took his fountain-pen and—though
he had no idea when he could post it—began
the composition of a long letter home. He was so
engrossed with this employment that he did not notice
the hour, and it was not till Pork Chops summoned
him to lunch that he recalled with a start that the two
hunters were still away. However, he assured
himself it was probable that they had found good
hunting in some distant part of the island and that
they had not, like himself, realized how late it was
getting.</p>

<p class='c009'>This done he walked uneasily up and down, waiting
impatiently for the return of the hunters. He was
really anxious and could no longer disguise from
himself the fact that something of a serious nature
must have happened to keep them out away so long.
His mind ran the gamut of every accident, from
snake-bite to accidental shooting, but he was as far
from guessing the real truth as he was from being at
ease in his mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bang!” A long pause—then again, “Bang—Bang.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the alarm signal agreed upon by Ben Stubbs
before the hunters left camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reports came from some distance in the forest,
and Lathrop, hastily getting his gun and half crazy
with anxiety, answered it as soon as he could slip in
the cartridges.</p>

<p class='c009'>What could have happened?</p>

<p class='c009'>Firing frequently and being answered at closer
intervals all the time, Lathrop advanced into the
jungle and had not proceeded very far when he encountered
a strange figure.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Billy Barnes, but a white-faced Billy, his
clothes torn by creepers and his face scratched and
cut by his wanderings in the jungle. A very different
figure from the usual trig one cut by the young
reporter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Billy, what has happened?” gasped Lathrop,
shocked at his companion’s woe-begone appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reporter’s reply was sufficiently alarming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ben Stubbs has disappeared!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Disappeared?” echoed the amazed Lathrop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, as utterly as if the earth had opened and
swallowed him,” was the reply, in a strained, tired
voice. “I’ve hunted for him all the afternoon and
I have not been able to find a trace of him. I got
almost cut to ribbons in the sharp-leaved briars or
whatever you call them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He ruefully regarded his torn hands and ragged
clothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are sure he is not merely hunting in another
part of the island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certain,” was the dispiriting reply, “you see it
happened like this—we had shot a couple of turkeys
when Ben suggested our separating and getting a
bigger bag in that way than we would by hunting
together. We were to rejoin each other at the end of
half an hour, the signal being two shots. At the end
of half an hour I fired two shots but there was no answer.
I tried again, and there was still no reply but
the echo of my shots. I was scared then, I tell you,
and fired the danger signal. Still there was no answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, I was rattled. I plunged about in
the woods till I got all ripped up as you see and
shouted for Ben till I thought my throat would crack,
but I didn’t get a trace or a sign of him. Then I
recovered my wits a bit and got out my compass. I
headed for camp, and when I judged I was near
enough for you to hear me, I fired the danger signal—you
answered it, and here I am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Billy, what are we going to do?” exclaimed
the younger boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Make the best of it till we are certain Ben is lost,
and then communicate with the <em>Tarantula</em> and Frank
and Harry,” said the practical Billy. “Cheer up, we
don’t know yet that any actual harm has befallen him,
it’s the mystery of the thing that worries me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must send a wireless to Frank and Harry at
once,” cried Lathrop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will do no such thing, young fellow,” rejoined
Billy. “In the first place they have got troubles
enough of their own right now; and, in the second, a
man is never lost till you’ve sent out a general alarm
for him, and he is still missing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A general alarm?” repeated Lathrop, puzzled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, that’s reporter’s slang for advertising for a
missing man. Well, we can’t advertise here unless
the herons and mocassins get out a gazette, but we
can take the canoes to-morrow and make a thorough
circuit of the island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Greatly comforted by Billy’s assumed light-heartedness,
Lathrop tramped back to camp by his side in
a more cheerful frame of mind. As a matter of fact,
Billy was feeling what he himself would have described
as “pretty blue,” but he was sensible enough
to know that the best way to face the emergencies of
life is to look at them from the best possible aspect
and not give up hope till every way out of difficulty
has been tried.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime what had happened was this, and
it was sufficiently alarming. Ben, after he parted
from Billy, had followed a fascinating “Ke-ouk
ke-ouk” through the brush till he found himself
near the margin of the creek that flowed round the
island. He had reached the brink and was looking
inquiringly about him to ascertain what might have
become of the big gobbler when he felt a rope thrown
over his head from behind, and the next minute the
big ex-sailor, great as was his strength, was struggling
in the arms of a dozen men. Who his captors
were he was unable to see, for as the rope had tightened,
his great arms were pinioned close to his side,
forcing at the same time his gun from his grip, and
a thick blanket had been thrown over his head.
Blinded and half suffocated, Ben felt himself picked
up and hustled through the wood. He tried to shout
but the blanket effectually muffled his voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a few minutes of this rapid traveling Ben
felt himself thrown into what he instinctively realized
was a canoe and then being paddled rapidly over the
water. In what direction they were proceeding he
had of course no means of knowing, but from the few
words his captors had exchanged he knew he was in
the hands of the Seminoles. Of the object of his abduction
he could not even hazard a guess.</p>

<p class='c009'>After about an hour of traveling Ben, through
his smothering blanket, heard the loud barking of
dogs and crying of children, and knew that they must
be near a settlement of some kind. He was not left in
doubt. The canoe’s keel grated on the beach the next
minute and he was dragged out and propelled toward
the center of the sound. He felt dogs come sniffing
about his legs and kicked out viciously. He grinned
under his blanket as he heard one limp away with ear-piercing
howls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s one trouble disposed of,” thought Ben
to himself, “what’s coming now. I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was not kept long in suspense. He was suddenly
halted and the cloth jerked off his head. His
wrists, however, were not unbound. It was now
dark, and in the sudden glare of firelight that confronted
him, Ben’s eyes refused their duty for a minute
or so. As he grew accustomed to the light, however,
and looked about him he saw that he stood in the
center of a ring of palmetto-thatched huts which were
crowded with women and children, all heavily laden
with beads—in fact these were about all the clothing
the children wore—while all about him were grouped
grave-faced men with bright-colored turbans on their
heads, one of whom he at once recognized as the chief
who had visited them with Quatty the previous afternoon
and promised them freedom from annoyance
while they were in the limits of the ’glades.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is a dern fine way you keep your promises,”
roared the captive Ben indignantly, while the women
snickered and the men regarded him with stolid
curiosity, “you cigar-store Injuns you, if I had my
hands free I’d hammer you into lobscouse. I’d show
you the kind of a buck sailorman I am. I thought
you promised us you wouldn’t disturb us and here
you clap my head in a mainsail and furl me in it till I
can’t use my deadlights to see day from night. Keelhaul
you, if I had you aboard a ship I’d masthead the
lot of you till you fell overboard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was not a word in reply and the chief stood
with folded arms, as immobile as if Ben had not
spoken a word.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you’re all going to play deaf, are you,” bellowed
the enraged ex-sailorman, “well, it won’t go
down with me, my hearties. I know you can hear,—oh,
if only I had my hands free I’d put some life into
you—you—you row of tenpins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here Ben stopped, because he was completely out
of breath with his volcanic outburst. While he was
getting ready for a fresh eruption, to his surprise one
of the younger men stepped forward from the solemn
circle and in excellent English, considering the place
and by whom it was spoken, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You all through big talk, white man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All through,” sputtered the amazed Ben, “yes,
I’m through, that is for the present. And now, as you
seem to be the only one of this collection of dummies
that has any glimmering of sense, will you please tell
me why I am fetched here like a ship’s cat going
aboard a strange craft, all tied up in a bag?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No savee—ship’s cat,” replied the Seminole
quietly; “plentee—savee, white man tell heap lie—all
time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Calling me a liar, now are you, you mahogany-colored
lobster,” yelled Ben, “I’d like to get one
good punch at you, my matey.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All white men liars,” blandly went on the Indian,
“steal our land—all time break word to us—um no
good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?” demanded Ben.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” went on the spokesman of the tribe, “you
stay here lilly while—we no hurt you. When you
fren’s go then you go, too. They no hurt us we no
hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, is that so?” replied Ben, “werry good of
you, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You eat plenty sofkee—plenty fowl—plenty
tobac. Good time plenty, how?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Ben had been in tight places in his adventurous
career and he was by no means disposed to offend the
Seminoles by seeming over anxious to get away, at
least for the present, for he knew that if he did so any
chance that his wrist gyves would be removed would
be lost, so he acquiesced gracefully to all the Indian
had said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, old odds-and-ends,” he said, “I’ll act
as hostage as long as you feed me well and give me
plenty to smoke. Now, take off these.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as his reply had been translated to the
chief, and that dignitary had agreed, the ropes that
bound Ben’s wrists were cut and he was at comparative
liberty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sofkee?” questioned the young Indian who had
conducted the negotiations, indicating a huge pot
simmering on the fire. And then for the first time
Ben tasted that delectable standby dish of the
Seminoles, which is composed of birds, rabbits, turtles, fish,
corn, potatoes, sweet and white, peppers, beans and
anything else that comes to hand. There is a big
kettle of it kept handy in every Seminole village and
anyone who happens along is at liberty to help himself.
There is only one drawback to the dish from
fastidious folks’ point of view, and that is that every
one helps him or herself from the same big wooden
spoon. But Ben was not fastidious and he made a
hearty meal of the savory compound, and then after a
pipe or two of tobacco, appeared to compose himself
to sleep on a pile of skins laid on the floor of the palmetto-thatched
hut assigned to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He simulated slumber till midnight when, as no
one appeared to be watching, he rose and tiptoed out
of the camp and down to the water’s edge where the
canoes were moored. He was about to launch one
when a tall figure stepped out of the gloom of the trees
and pointed a rifle straight at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huh—white man go back—or Injun shoot,”
said the figure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ben, as has been said, was a wise man—he went
back.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <br />THE BOY AVIATORS TRAPPED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The trail on which Frank and Harry found themselves
wound irregularly through dense groves of
wild fig, orange, custard apple and palmetto trees,
through which from time to time they could catch
glimpses of the dark, monotonous brown sea of the
Everglades stretching away into the remote distance.
They plodded along it not speaking a word, through
undergrowth that at times brushed their arms, crackling
in an annoying fashion to anyone who wanted his
advance to be unheralded. The growth was as dry as
tinder and Frank could not help thinking to himself
that a fire once started among it would rage through
the forest as if it had been soaked with kerosene.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly, and without a moment’s warning, Frank
tripped and fell flat on his face, his rifle shooting out
of his hands and falling with a loud crash on the
hard-baked ground. This was bad enough in itself
but there was a worse shock in store for the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>A moment’s glance sufficed to show them that a
wire had been stretched across the trail at this point
and that, as Frank’s foot struck it and he tripped, a
loud, clanging alarm-bell began to sound and by the
loudness of its uproarious clangor, it could not be more
than a few paces from where they then were.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quick, Harry! Run for your life!” said Frank,
in a low, tense voice, scrambling to his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have struck an alarm wire and in a minute
we shall have a dozen men on our track.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Stumbling along the rough path the boys began to
make the best speed they could over its uneven surface.
But the tough journey they had made through
the muddy trail among the saw-grass, and the fact
that they had not eaten for some hours and were feeling
somewhat faint, made a fast speed impossible.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had not gone more than a few hundred yards
when Harry gave a gasp and pressed his hand to his
side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, Harry?” asked Frank, through his
parched lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep on, Frank,” gasped the younger boy, “you
can make it if you hurry. I’m tuckered out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, make an effort, you’ve got to,” said Frank
sternly, realizing that now was no time to sympathize
with his younger brother, although he hated to
use the sharp tone he thought it expedient to assume.</p>

<p class='c009'>The younger boy rose to his feet. Pluckily he staggered
on a few steps but sank to the ground again,
overcome with the pain of the sharp “stitch” in his
side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on, Frank,” he whispered in a faint voice,
“you go on. I’ll get through somehow,” he added
bravely, with a pitiful effort at a confident smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As if I’d leave you,” said Frank, indignantly,
“can’t you run another foot, old boy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I really can’t, Frank,” gasped Harry, “I
couldn’t move if I was to be killed the next minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I’ll have to carry you,” decided Frank,
“I’ve done it when you were a little fellow, and I
guess I can manage it now. Put your arms round my
neck—so. Now then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With his added burden Frank struggled gamely on,
though every step was telling heavily on him.</p>

<p class='c009'>If they could only reach the little glade of cabbage
palms, there was a pile of rocks there, he recollected,
behind which they could hide. Speed meant everything,
and pressing his lips together determinedly,
Frank swore to himself that he would make the rocks
or die.</p>

<p class='c009'>And somehow by a supreme effort of will, he made
them. Though how he managed that last sickening
effort of half dragging and half carrying his inanimate
burden across the little grove he never recollected.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he made it and, having scrambled up the rough
crevices in the pile of stone in which he hoped to find
a safe asylum, he dragged his half-fainting brother
into position beside him.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now he could hear far back in the brush loud
shouts and orders coming thick and fast. What a
fool he had been not to realize that men engaged on
such a hazardous enterprise as were the bogus manufacturers
of Chapinite would have more cunning
than to leave their retreat unguarded by alarm appliances.
If only he had watched the trail more carefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was too late for vain regrets now; they
would have to trust to luck to avoid detection for,
judging by the noise and the number of different
voices, the search for the invaders was to be a hot
one. The young leader tried grittily to choke back
the great, panting gasps in which his breath came
after his exertions. But he might as well have attempted
to stop a cataract, as to check his sobbing
respiration. To him his deep breaths sounded as loud
as the reports of minute guns.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now a fresh peril made itself manifest. A
deep baying sound arose far up the trail, which Frank
recognized, with a violent throb of the heart, as the
sound of bloodhounds, giving tongue on the scent.
Their discovery was inevitable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you handle your revolver, Harry?” he asked
of his younger brother, who was now somewhat recovered,
thanks to the shade and the rest he had had.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Frank,” whispered Harry, hoarsely, and then
the next minute, noticing Frank’s troubled face, as
the baying grew louder and nearer, “you needn’t tell
me, old fellow, what that means—it’s bloodhounds.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank nodded gravely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid our chances of seeing the <em>Golden Eagle
II</em> and our comrades are about nil,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other boy did not reply. He was listening to
the sounds of the dogs baying and the savage human
shouts that grew momentarily nearer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t use the revolvers unless you have to,”
whispered Frank, whose wind was now returning,—“but
the first dog that comes over the top of the rock—knife
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry nodded and drew his heavy hunting-knife
from its case. Frank did the same.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now we are ready for all comers,” said Harry,
with a wan smile, gripping the horn handle of his
blade with a determined grip.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had not long to wait. From their nest in the
rocks they saw the first dog, a huge, bristly-haired
Cuban bloodhound, with heavy hackles and blood-shot
eyes, come bounding into the clearing, sniffing
the ground and from time to time throwing his head
into the air with a loud ringing bay that chilled the
blood.</p>

<p class='c009'>The animal was followed by half a dozen others of
his own breed. Without a moment’s hesitation they
made straight across the glade and for the rocks.
The first one scrambled up with difficulty, and as his
dripping fangs showed over the top of the rampart
of rock, Frank’s arm shot out and he fell back with a
choking growl—dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next of the savage beasts fell before Harry’s
knife, a great gaping wound in its throat; but after
that the boys were no match for the four huge beasts
that fell on them at once. Frank felt the teeth of one
brute grip him through his stout khaki clothes while
he had his hands on the throat of another, choking
its life out. Harry had plunged his knife into another
and was turning desperately on its mate when
there was a sudden interruption of the impending
tragedy.</p>

<p class='c009'>A sharp, clear whistle rang through the clearing
and the survivors of the brutes that had attacked the
boys limped dispiritedly away from them and shuffled
in the direction from which the summons had proceeded.
From their eyrie in the rocks the boys saw
two dozen or more small yellow men, in white duck
jackets and trousers, with yellow straw slippers on
their feet, rush into the glen followed by a tall man in
a sort of undress naval uniform. He it was who had
given the whistle. He gave an evil laugh as he saw
the wounded, exhausted animals come shuffling
toward him, their tails between their legs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are in the rocks yonder, boys. Surround
them!” he ordered in a sharp, harsh voice. “They
shall pay dearly for each of my beauties they have
killed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the little brown men, who wore a red band
about his arm and seemed to be a leader among them,
shouted some sharp orders to his fellow countrymen
and they spread about the rocks in a circle. The first
impulse of the boys had been to run for it but they
realized, even as the thought entered their minds, that
it would be useless in their exhausted condition to try
to make their escape. Each of their opponents was
armed and while they also carried weapons, still they
could only have stood off an attack for a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a shout the little brown men rushed at the
Boy Aviators as they stood side by side, but they
hesitated and fell back as Frank and his brother aimed
their revolvers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not want to take human life,” cried Frank,
“but the first one of you that lays a hand on us I’ll
shoot him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very fine talk,” sneered the big white man, striding
up, “but there are twelve of us here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” replied Frank, undaunted, and tapping the
magazine of his revolver, “and there are twice twelve
here and they all come out at once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The big man paused a minute and bit his lip. For
a minute he seemed about to give orders to his
followers to fire on the boys and shoot them down where
they stood. He evidently thought better of his intention
later, however, for he said, with a change of voice
from his original harsh, rasping tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are several things I want to talk to you
about, Frank Chester—you see I know you and your
brother Harry—will you give up your weapons and
agree to accompany me to my camp if on my part I
give my word not to harm you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank realized in that instant that the man who
faced him was Captain Mortimer Bellman, the renegade
American officer, and he also weighed and
recognized the value of a pledge from such a man;
but they were in position where there was nothing to
be gained by fighting and in which much benefit might
accrue to them from temporizing—so:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” he said, “we will go with you.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <br />A STARTLING MEETING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The legion of little brown men at once fell in
round the two boys, whose clean cut young figures
towered above their squat forms, and after they had
surrendered their weapons—not without a momentary
qualm of regret on Frank’s part—the march to the
camp began.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bellman said little as they made their way along
the trail, but strode along with his hands clasped behind
his back as though in deep thought. He was a
huge man, with a singularly brutal face bronzed by
the suns of a dozen countries over which he had been
a wanderer, and a heavy drooping mustache which
hid a cruel mouth. His eyes were steely gray and as
keen as a hawk’s. Such was the man into whose
power the Boy Aviators had fallen and even they did
not realize the extent to which such a man will go to
gain an end—and that he had an end in view his action
in sparing their lives fully convinced them.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last they emerged—after passing once more
over the luckless wire—on the settlement under the
hill that Frank had noted the night before from the
boat. There was every evidence of abandonment
about it, however, even now, although it had been so
recently the scene of activity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you had come to-morrow I should not have
had the pleasure of receiving you,” said Bellman,
with a sardonic grin, waving his hand to indicate the
preparations for the abandonment of the settlement.</p>

<p class='c009'>The blast furnace had been almost completely
demolished and a gang of men, compatriots of the
small brown men who formed the boys’ escort, were
busily engaged in completing the work of destruction
with crowbars and picks. Several of the small houses
which Frank had seen from the boat had also vanished
and the rest were portable contrivances. They were
being rapidly taken to pieces and carried up the hill
into the woods, where doubtless they were to be
destroyed, for the smoke of a big fire was beginning
to rise from there.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the side of the hill back of the blast furnace, a
great ragged hole had been torn like a small quarry,
and a runway from this to the shattered blast-furnace
indicated that some earth found in the hillside was
reduced in the crucible to a condition in which it
formed an ingredient of Chapinite. The large building
was evidently a sort of bunk-house for the workmen
and packing-house for the product that Captain
Bellman and his men had been making there, for from
its wide door a perpetual stream of dwarfed brown
men were carrying packing cases carefully wrapped
in straw to a small fleet of canoes that lay moored
alongside a primitive wharf.</p>

<p class='c009'>All these things the boys’ eyes took in as they were
led across the bare earth to the barrack-like building;
but of the man to search for whom they had come to
the Everglades they could see no sign.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bellman’s first care was for his wounded dogs, after
which he ordered his men to bring the boys into a
long, low ceiled room, apparently from its heat right
under the roof of the bunk-house. Straw mats laid
all along the walls also indicated that it was used as a
sleeping attic by the Orientals employed on the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a small table in the room with a rickety
chair by it, and Bellman took up a seat at it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We need not occupy much time,” were his first
words, as the boys stood facing him, surrounded by
their impassive-faced guards. “I and my men are
leaving the Everglades forever to-night. We wish to
be secure against anybody following us. Where is
this air-ship of yours and where are the canoes in
which you brought it here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why do you wish to know?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I naturally wish to make myself secure from
pursuit by destroying them,” was the cool reply, “if
you don’t wish to tell me I shall find them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank knew that this last was an empty boast as to
search the Everglades for their canoes or for their
air-ship either would be a work occupying much more
time than Bellman could afford to spare.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Under no circumstances will I give you any such
information,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I admire your pluck but deplore your lack of
common sense,” rejoined Bellman with a sneer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We don’t care any more for your admiration
than we do for your sympathy,” replied Frank,
proudly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bellman’s dark face flushed angrily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is the way you treat my intended kindness,”
he thundered, striking the table with his clenched fist
till its crazy legs wobbled under it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I shall try another method. If you had
answered me I would have sent some Seminoles here
to pick you up, once I was safe at sea, but as it is
now I shall leave you here to rot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Little as Frank believed Bellman’s tentative
promise that he would send relief to them if they
afforded him the opportunity to raid their camp and
destroy their canoes and the <em>Golden Eagle II</em>, yet
both boys realized not without dismay that there was
a good deal of deadly earnest in the last words he
had spoken.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leave them there to rot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Involuntarily both boys shuddered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bellman’s malevolent eye saw this and interpreted
it at once as a sign of weakening.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah,” he said viciously, “I touched you there,
eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know what you mean by that,” said Frank,
“but if you intend to convey that we are afraid of
you, we are not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or of any cad that has been kicked out of the
United States’ Navy, and has turned against his
country,” added Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You young whelp,” shouted Bellman, beside
himself at the sneer, “you have tried to checkmate me
at every turn, but you’ll find out I am more than your
match.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You come here to find Lieutenant Chapin, the dog
who was instrumental in my disgrace. Well, I’ll introduce
you to him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He gave a sharp order in the same tongue his followers
used and the next minute the boys were seized.
With a good, left-hand punch to the jaw Frank
knocked one of the amazed little brown men half
across the room and the next minute Harry had
served another the same way. But it was no good.
The opposing force was too many for them and
ignominiously handcuffed they were at length led
down several steep flights of stairs into what they
knew, by its musty smell, must be an underground
chamber.</p>

<p class='c009'>The darkness of the place was made visible, so to
speak, by a smoky oil-torch, like those used in the
stoke-hold of a steamer, that hung in one corner. It
was miserably damp and several subterranean streams
fed by the mountain above trickled across the floor.
In one corner the boys noticed, as their eyes grew accustomed
to the light, was a curious contrivance
formed of two long bars of heavy wood with holes
pierced in them at regular intervals.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two heavy posts stood at each end of this contrivance,
to which were attached heavy padlocks and
hasps. With a quick thrill of horror the boys realized
that they faced that instrument of confinement of
blue-law days—the stocks.</p>

<p class='c009'>After another sharp order from Bellman their captors
carried them to the appliance and raising the
heavy upper block of wood thrust the boys’ legs into
the semicircular openings cut in the lower section for
that purpose. Similar holes were cut in the upper
bar and when it was lowered and padlocked down
the unfortunate person confined there could in no
way release himself till somebody unlocked the padlocks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” said Bellman, when this work was completed
to his satisfaction, and the boys were securely
fastened in their prison, “I am going to introduce
you to the man you have been looking for. Serang,”
he ordered, turning to the little brown man with the
red stripe on his arm, “Sahib Chapin bring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man nodded obediently and left the fetid
chamber. The boys wondered that he did not take
any companion with him, but when he returned,
leading a stumbling, helpless figure, they understood
that even a small man of his caliber was able now to
handle the once strapping Lieutenant Chapin. For
that in the figure before them, for all his unshaven
cheeks and blinking eyes, like those of a bat, they
had the man they had come all the way in search of,
his uniform, now bagging in unsightly fashion about
his shrunken form left them no room to doubt. The
miserable scarecrow figure that gazed apologetically
about it, was the inventor of Chapinite, and once the
most popular man in the United States Navy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys’ cheeks burned with indignation at the
sight, and if they might have had any weak inclination
to save their lives by yielding to Bellman’s demand
that they reveal the whereabouts of the <em>Golden
Eagle II</em>, the sight of the miserable wreck before
them would at once have decided them. They would
stick by the unfortunate officer come what might and
if possible, avenge the indignities he had suffered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Put him in alongside them, serang,” ordered
Bellman, as Chapin gazed about in a dazed manner,
evidently realizing little of what was transpiring and
in a few minutes Lieutenant Chapin, Frank Chester
and his brother Harry, were trussed up in a row absolutely
helpless. It was a bitter thought that here
they were within hand’s reach of the man they had
come so far and endured so much to succor, and now
they were as helpless to aid him as he seemed to be
to care for himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you a pleasant afternoon,” said Bellman,
as, signing to the serang, he and his myrmidons left
the subterranean chamber.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as their footsteps had died out Frank determined
to make an effort to arouse the dormant
faculties of Lieutenant Chapin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lieutenant,” he said, “we are your friends. Can
you understand us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>To his amazement a light of brighter intelligence
shone in the captive officer’s face and he answered with
what was absolute briskness compared to his former
listless manner:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I can; but who are you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Rapidly Frank sketched out to him the events that
had brought them there and all they had hoped to accomplish.
Then in a saddened voice he had related
the failure of their hopes and aspirations.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lieutenant thanked them warmly for their
loyalty, but urged them to save their lives if possible
by acceding to Bellman’s demands. For himself, he
said, he expected no better fate than to be left there to
die.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My life has been a living death at any rate,” he
said, “since I came to this terrible place. Yours are
the first kindly faces I have seen. I have lived as if
in a dream.” He pressed his hand to his forehead.
“It seems that I must do what they told me. I have
even, as you know, aided in the betrayal of my government
by aiding these men in preparing my invention.
For the last two days, though, my mind has been getting
clearer. I have realized what is going on about
me. I can judge things in their true proportions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But—pardon me for the question—” said Frank,
“but when you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know,” interrupted the lieutenant, “you are going
to say that when I came in here, I seemed stupefied.
I was acting a part. I did not want Bellman to think
that I had recovered my senses. I cannot understand
it myself. Until yesterday everything was like a
dream, now I can think once more like a rational
man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank detailed to him the conversation that they
had overheard in the boat the night before and the
boast that Foyashi had made that he had placed the
captive under his control.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, that is it,” exclaimed the lieutenant eagerly,
“since Foyashi has gone I have felt this new
life of my brain, but hark—there’s somebody
coming.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His ears, sharpened by his long captivity, were
keener than the boys’ for it was not till the serang with
the red band on his arm entered the place that they
heard any indication of the arrival of the newcomer.
He came straight up to the boys and informed
them that it was the order of his master that he should
search them. His manner was not insolent or rough,
it was simply the manner of the lay figure who does
as he is told and asked no questions. Indignant but
helpless Harry submitted to the search. He begged
the man to let him keep his mother’s picture which he
carried in a case in his inside pocket, but the man refused
with a mechanical shake of the head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my orders. Tuan he say take everything,”
he muttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came Frank’s turn. As with Harry one by
one his most treasured possessions were stripped from
him by the immobile faced, yellow man. But suddenly
something happened that had been entirely unlooked
for. Frank had entirely forgotten the squatting
Buddha, which he had placed in his pocket the day
the moonshiner had sold it to him, and had not given
it a thought since.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, however, the serang’s searching hand found
it in the boy’s pocket and the effect on him was electrical.</p>

<p class='c009'>He fell on his knees reverentially before the absurd
looking piece of jade and beat his head on the damp
floor and then gazed at Frank in awe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How came you by this, master?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank saw that the possession of the thing had
made a strong effect on the man and that to deceive
him as to the fact in the case, might have a beneficial
bearing on their position, so he simply shook his head
and as Harry would have said, “looked wise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Him great Buddha of Lhasa,” moaned the serang,
bobbing up and down before it. “You great man.
Me worship you if you give him me for keep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why don’t you steal it from us; we can’t prevent
you?” Harry could not help saying.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No can steal. If steal heap curse all time. Plenty
soon die,” was the response, “but if give then great
blessing—plenty blessing all time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A sudden idea struck Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are leaving here to-night in canoes for the
coast?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” was the reply, “we leave here never no
more to come back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I give you that Buddha will you unlock these
stocks and these handcuffs before you go?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man thought a minute.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you don’t I will make the Buddha curse you,”
pursued Frank. This seemed to decide the yellow man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All litee,” he said, “before I go I lettee you out
but no let Bellman know; he kill me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We won’t let him know,” said Frank with emphasis,
“but how do we know that you will keep your
word?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I don’t then Buddha curse me and I die,” said
the man simply as he left the dungeon. The boys felt
that they had secured a pledge of freedom by the
merest chance that was better than all the promises
that could be made from now till Doomsday.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXV' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <br />QUATTY AS A SCOUT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Acting on Billy’s suggestion Lathrop did not, as
we know, wireless any news of the disappearance of
Ben Stubbs to the Boy Aviators. He in fact agreed,
after some pondering of the situation, with the reporter’s
opinion that it was needless to worry them
when they already had their hands full. The night
after Ben Stubbs’ mysterious vanishment was passed
in no very agreeable way by the young dwellers
at Camp Walrus and as for Pork Chops his wails
when he learned of it rang to heaven and back again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah jes’ knowed dat dis yer trip was hoodooed
fum de moment dat Marse Frank got dat lil’ green
mummery from dat moonshine man,” he said gloomily,
and made dire and dismal prophecies till Billy, seeing
that Lathrop was very nearly breaking down under
the strain, packed the skipper of the <em>Carrier Dove</em> off
to bed. Billy and Lathrop spent most of the night
hours—except when they fell into troubled dozes
from time to time—seated beside the silent wireless
instrument, hoping against hope that news of some
kind might be received from the boys. Ben’s self-reliance
and adaptability had made itself so manifest
on the expedition that, as Billy said, it seemed impossible
to believe that any really serious mishap had befallen
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again and again as they sat by the fire the boys
went over and over the puzzling affair. Lathrop repeated
his story to Billy a dozen times and each time
the young reporter asked for a repetition hoping that
some point that would shed a light on the mystery
might have been omitted by the other. But Lathrop’s
recitals of the incident varied not at all and Billy was
fain to give it up at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve worked on a lot of queer disappearance
cases,” he remarked sententiously, “but this has them
all beaten by ten blocks and the City Hall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And when Billy dropped off into a troubled nap he
had a vivid dream that his city editor had presented
him with a big crocodile, stuffed in a lifelike manner
and equipped with silver teeth and claws of enormous
size. The young reporter was in the midst of an
elaborate speech of thanks when he awoke and found
that the first gray heralding of dawn was broad in
the east and that the great multitude of herons and
fish-eating birds that roosted among the islands was
already beginning its pilgrimage to the feeding grounds
on the oyster bars of the Archipelago. Dawn in the
Everglades is a beautiful and impressive sight, but
Billy at that time had no eyes for it. His sole thought
was to find Ben Stubbs. He therefore aroused
Lathrop and the two boys, after routing out Pork
Chops and making him cook them a quick breakfast
and put them up a light lunch, started for the canoes,
determined to circumnavigate the island in search of
their missing comrade. Carefully they explored every
inch of the soft muddy beach and in due time arrived
at the spot where several feet, intermingled in an inextricable
pattern, marked the spot where the Seminoles
had blindfolded and kidnapped Ben.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy, with a reporter’s trained instinct, was on his
hands and knees in a minute and came amazingly near
reconstructing the scene of Ben’s capture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ben was seized by several men—Indians I should
say. He made a brief resistance but was overpowered
and dragged some distance and then carried. He was
then hurled into an Indian canoe, which was followed
by two others, and taken to some Indian village;
where or why, I don’t know,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Lathrop, laughing,
in spite of his heavy heart, at Billy’s surprising
enthusiasm, which led him to construct what seemed
to the other boy at best a fanciful theory, “like Dr.
Watson I can understand part of your reasoning,
namely that he was seized by Indians for I can see the
marks of their moccasins, I can also understand—knowing
Ben as I do—that he struggled;” he
chuckled again as he pictured the wiry, steel-muscled
Ben laying out his captors, “but for the rest please
explain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s simple enough, my dear Watson,” said Billy
in the manner of the celebrated sleuth of fiction,
“Ben’s boots had hob-nails—very well, I can see that
after stamping round a lot, hob-nails were dragged
by moccasins—see the little lines they made in the
sand? Then the lines stop but there are no more hobnails,
clearly then he was carried.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but the two canoes that followed the one they
put him in?” asked Lathrop. “How do you know
that there were two others?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ridiculously simple,” replied Billy, “here is the
mark made by the keel of one canoe; beyond that, my
dear Watson, if you will use your eyes, you will see
two other keel marks—hence three canoes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I am a dummy,” exclaimed Lathrop, considerably
vexed that he had not puzzled the problem
out for himself, “but I don’t see how that puts us any
further—in fact it makes it more inexplicable for the
Indians, through that rascal Quatty, promised us that
they would not molest the camp and yet, if your theory
is the right one, they have carried off one of the most
valuable members of our party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hum,” said Billy and scratched his head, “there’s
one thing, however,” he said consolingly, “they can’t
mean him any real harm or else they would probably
have killed him right here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe they are cannibals and mean to eat him,”
suggested Lathrop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’d be a pretty tough morsel,” laughed Billy,
“but don’t worry about that, Lathrop, the Seminoles
are not cannibals and from all I hear are pretty good
sort of people, as Indians go. I have got a sort of an
inkling that we shall hear from Ben before very long
in some way or another.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope so,” said Lathrop and then—there being
nothing else to do—they paddled back to the camp.
It was then past noon and after waiting for some word
from the boys for an hour or more their two comrades
determined to call them up and acquaint them
with what had happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>Patiently Lathrop operated the <em>Golden Eagle’s</em> call
for half-an-hour or more.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter?” asked Billy, seeing a troubled
look on the boy’s face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand it,” responded the other boy,
“I can’t raise them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep on trying,” urged Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was no good, there was no answer from the
<em>Golden Eagle</em> for a reason that our readers know. At
the time that Lathrop was shooting his urgent summons
into space the boys were lying in the stocks on
Captain Bellman’s island.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thoroughly alarmed Lathrop sent out the navy call
and after a short time got into communication with the
<em>Tarantula</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lieutenant Selby himself responded, after the operator
had told him of Lathrop’s grave news. For an
hour he and Lathrop talked across space and it was
finally agreed that the <em>Tarantula</em> was to send a detachment
of men to the island with a machine-gun and
other provisions and that if the boys did not shortly
reappear a relief expedition would be started into the
interior after them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is your latitude and longitude?” spelled out
the <em>Tarantula’s</em> wireless, when the arrangements had
been completed. At Lathrop’s request Billy hurried
into the hut and fetched out Frank’s log-book in which,
in his neat writing, the position of the island was
jotted down:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Latitude 25° 29’ 30" N,” he read out, “Longitude
80. 56. 45. W.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the young reporter read off Frank’s entries
Lathrop rattled them out on the wireless and when
they had been repeated through the air, to make
certain they were correct, he cut out the instrument.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s queer that if Frank’s information was correct
that there is no sign of the submarine at the mouth
of Jew-Fish River,” remarked Lathrop.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy agreed with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How far is the river mouth from here?” he asked.
Lathrop fetched the map and weighting down the
corners with stones till it lay flat on the ground, both
boys studied it intently. Lathrop announced, after a
few minutes’ figuring with dividers and compass, that
the river—at the mouth of which the submarine of the
Far Eastern power was supposed to be,—was not
more than ten miles from the island on which they
were then encamped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If only the boys were here we could make it in the
canoes in a short time,” sighed Billy, “but what are we
to do? we don’t know a thing about navigation and we
could never find it without Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s so,” agreed Lathrop. “Oh,” he burst out
suddenly, “I wish we’d never seen the Everglades.
If only we could get safe on board the <em>Tarantula</em> I believe
I’d stay there till she sailed for home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And leave the boys here,” exclaimed Billy, “not
much you wouldn’t—not if you are the kind of boy I
take you for. Cheer up, Lathrop, we’ll pull out all
right. I was with Frank and Harry in Nicaragua in
places that you’d think three boys could never have
escaped from, but we got through all right and we’ll
get through this—try that old sparker of yours
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lathrop once more adjusted his operator’s harness
and sent wave after wave humming through the air in
search of the <em>Golden Eagle II’s</em> answering vibrations,
but no reply came and at last he gave up in sheer
weariness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s more than fifteen hours since we have heard
from them,” he said in despair, “and Frank promised
not to remain out of communication with us for long,
unless something very serious had occurred. What can
be the matter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps her apparatus is out of order,” suggested
Billy, “and they are not getting your calls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With an expert like Frank looking after it—not
likely,” replied the other boy. “I wish I could consider
it probable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pork Chops had gone down to the canoe anchorage
to fish earlier in the afternoon. To his simple mind it
was necessary for him to provide his young masters
with as good food as possible even though the world
were to come to an end; so, seated on a branch overhanging
the clear water, he had angled with good luck
all the afternoon. As it grew dusk he muttered to himself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dis yar trip ain’t nuffin’ but foolishness no how.
Ah jes’ wish ah’d stayed hum at Miami, but Po’k
Chops, you fool niggah, you don’ nevah know when
youse is well off—no, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Shaking his head with deep conviction the darky
rolled up his tackle and thrusting a long creeper
through the gills of his fish he prepared to return to
camp. As he rose to his feet, however, he perceived
something coming toward him down the channel which
caused him to throw up his hands with a yell,
letting all his fish drop back into the water and
screaming:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ghoses!” at the top of his voice, the terrified
black raced for the friendly presence of Lathrop and
Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys’ first impression on seeing Pork Chops’
crazy antics was the wild anticipation that the boys
had returned. Their hopes were dashed the next second,
however, by the loud wails of their retainer:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, lawd, Marse Lath’op, oh, lawdy, Mr. Billy.
Ah seen a brack ghoses’ coming down de creek. Fo’
de Lawd’s sake, sah, don’ go; he put de hant on you,”
he cried in an agonized wail as Lathrop and Billy
started for the canoe anchorage to see what had caused
the demoralization of Pork Chops. For a minute they
were almost as startled as he as their eyes encountered
a figure sufficiently alarming to scare a stronger-minded
individual than Pork Chops.</p>

<p class='c009'>Staggering up from the anchorage was a figure
in pitiful rags with big, poppy white eyes staring
glassily out of a face as black as ink. The figure’s
hands were cut and bleeding and it wore, tied about
its head, a strip of calico torn from its shirt which lay
open, exposing a chest as black as its face. It was
several seconds before both the boys recognized this
object clearly, and exclaimed in a simultaneous gasp:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quatty!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Quatty it was; but a very different Quatty from the
usual debonair black answering to that name. It was
more like a ghost of Quatty. It was not till he had
been restored with coffee and food that the unfortunate
negro was able to render a clear account of
himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>His news was sufficiently disquieting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah sat der in de lilly canvas boat foh more’n
hour,” he said, after he had detailed the rest of the
boys’ adventures since leaving the camp, “an’ waited
fo’ dem to come back. Ah tho’ght fum de fus’ it was
a bobbery kin’ of fing to do, but Marse Frank and
Marse Harry——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will do, Quatty,” said Billy checking the
garrulous black, “keep to your story.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, sah,” continued Quatty, “I laid dere in de
boat waitin’,—it might have been up’ards of an hour—as
I said—when I hears de most confounded debbil
racket of dogs yelping an’ shoutin’ as ever I did hear—yes,
sah. Wall, thinks I, I can creep through the
saw-grass a bit an’ see what it is, an’ I does;—den I
sees Marse Frank and Harry and a lot of fellers that
looked like Chinaman only smaller, an’ a big man who
seemed to be boss. Dey had dem two poor boys prisoners
an’ fum de looks ob dem I knew I couldn’t hev
done no good dere, so I jes’ gets in de boat and
paddles and poles back yar and I declare I was
mos’ tuckered when dat misbul, ignant savage
yander, Po’k Chops, seen me an’ was no mo’ of a
gen’l’man dan to run fo’ he life like I been a
duppy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course the first part of his narrative, which is
already familiar to our readers, had put the boys in
possession of the facts about the <em>Golden Eagle II</em> and
the reason they got no answer to their calls. After
wirelessing Lieutenant Selby the momentous news the
boys held a long consultation, while Pork Chops and
Quatty sat on opposite sides of the camp-fire and
glowered at each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>The upshot of their discussion was that it was
their duty to set out immediately and if possible recover
the air-ship and rescue the boys. It was a plan
full of risks, but where the lives of their comrades
were at stake neither boy felt inclined to hold back.
As Quatty’s strength had by now quite returned, with
the quick recuperative powers of the out-door negro,
and he was quite sure he could guide them to the
mound-builders’ island, as well by night as by day,
they agreed to start at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>The canoes were hastily loaded with duffle and as,
with Lathrop and Billy in one and Quatty leading in
the other, they made their way along the dark channels,
Lathrop was blessing the days back in old New
York when he had determined to learn to run an aeroplane.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVI' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <br />LATHROP AS AN AIR PILOT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Dere she is, massa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Quatty’s dark figure standing up in the canoe was
outlined against the deep ultramarine blue of the night
sky as he pointed to an indistinct blur on the horizon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She” both the boys instantly realized with a thrill
was the mound-builders’ island on which the <em>Golden
Eagle II</em> had been left. They had been paddling hard
all night and sometimes poling where the maze of
streams they followed shallowed to a mere puddle.
With the sudden nearing of their goal a new fear was
borne in upon them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Would the aeroplane be there? Or had the same
mysterious forces that held the Boy Aviators captive
wrecked their ship, too?</p>

<p class='c009'>Silently—after the first flush of the excitement at
Quatty’s having guided them right through a wilderness
that it seemed impossible to traverse except at
random—the boys paddled on. Their minds were
both busy with the same question. What would they
find when they got there? Perhaps after all their
errand would prove to be in vain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lathrop was the first to voice the apprehension,
they both felt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suppose the <em>Golden Eagle II</em> is gone?” he asked
in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we will hunt up the <em>Tarantula</em>, get a detachment
of bluejackets and clean out the Everglades before
we’ll give up the search,” was the determined
reply of the young reporter. Billy was rising to the
emergency.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun had already risen when the outlines of the
distant island became visible in detail and Billy, after
a long and careful scrutiny through the glasses, declared
he could see something that might or might not
be the <em>Golden Eagle II</em> perched on its summit. This
was cheering news and put new strength into the paddlers’
flagging arms. From that time on till they
reached the island and found that all was well the boys
did not speak a word, but put all their strength into
the work of urging the boats through the water. It
was aggravating work too, for at times they would be
only half a mile from the island and then they would
find that they were compelled to follow another watery
path that took them a couple of miles away from their
destination. At last, however, the keels of the little
flotilla grated on the island and Billy and Lathrop ran
up the well-worn trail leading to the summit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their joy at finding the air-ship intact may be
imagined. It was better luck than they had dared to
hope for. Speed was the main thing now and while
they might have reached the island of the formula
stealers by boat the journey there and back to the coast
again by water would have been a tedious one and
might indeed, by its very length, have defeated their
purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lathrop’s first care was to examine the gasolene supply.
He found to his satisfaction that the tank was
more than half full and he immediately dumped into
it the contents of the two five-gallon cans of reserve
supply that the boys had brought along and which were
stored under the transom.</p>

<p class='c009'>For an hour or more the boy went over the machine
carefully, striving to master to the minutest detail
its working parts. Lathrop was an aviator and
next to the boys, perhaps was as skilled a navigator
of aerial craft as the old school in New York had
turned out, but he was a little dubious about his ability
to run the <em>Golden Eagle II</em>. However, it had to be
done and after giving Billy careful instructions about
keeping the oil cups filled and seeing to it that the condenser
was in constant working order, Lathrop decided
that things were about ready for his experimental
flight in the Chester boys’ big aeroplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And to think that in White Plains I’d have given
my head to see it and here I am going to run her,” he
could not help saying to himself as he stepped back
and gave a final look over the craft.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under Lathrop’s direction the aeroplane was wheeled
back to the furthest boundary of the top of the mound
as he did not want to take chances on not securing a
good running start. Lathrop knew that aeroplanes are
like horses, they will go well for the man who is used
to them under almost any condition; but when a new
hand takes control accidents are likely to happen unless
the greatest care is used. As he well realized he
knew nothing of the habits of the <em>Golden Eagle II</em>,
which was a far bigger aeroplane than he had ever
run or in fact ever seen.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy’s heart beat a little faster as he clambered
into the pilot section of the chassis and adjured Billy
for the last time to look well to the engine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all right,” Billy anxiously assured him,
“I’m as good an engineer as Harry himself, or will
be,” he added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t holler till you’re out of the wood,” said
Lathrop, “and obey orders.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is curious how circumstances will alter cases.
Billy Barnes, by virtue of his greater age and knowledge
of the world was easily Lathrop’s leader, ordinarily.
Now, however, when Billy was about to enter
upon a duty of which he knew nothing and the other
boy a whole lot, their positions were readjusted and it
was Lathrop who became the leading spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Quatty, it had been agreed, was to be left behind,
and was to make his way back to the coast with the
canoes as soon as possible and apprise the <em>Tarantula</em>
people of what had occurred. He silently watched
the boys’ preparations with interest from a safe
distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, then, crank her up,” shouted Lathrop, as he
threw in the spark on the control wheel and waited
patiently for results as Billy turned and sweated at
the self-starting apparatus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter?” he demanded, as there was
no answering explosion from the engine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” stammered Billy wiping his brow,
“there doesn’t seem to be anything doing, does
there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What can be the matter?” exclaimed Lathrop,
throwing out the switch and coming aft.</p>

<p class='c009'>He examined the spark plugs in turn and found that
they were sparking in perfect order. Next came an
inspection of the carburettor—that, too, was in good
trim. Evidently the reason for the failure to start
was not there. Lathrop was puzzled, he had never
known an engine to behave in such a mystifying way
before. He went over it again part by part, carefully,
and cranked it and rocked it till his arms were ready
to drop off.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly an idea struck him—not so much for
the reasonableness of it, but because he had examined
about every other likely cause of failure to
start.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Billy, you are a wonder,” he exclaimed in a
vexed tone, when to his surprise he found that what he
tried in desperation proved correct.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the trouble?” asked Billy cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why you only forgot to open the gasolene valve,
that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For the first and last time in his life the reporter
was fairly taken back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Lathrop, I will admit that I am a first-class,
blown-in-the-bottle chump,” he exclaimed contritely.
The next cranking proved successful and after the
engines had settled down to a quiet easy purr, Lathrop
with a warning cry of:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold tight, I’m going to throw in the
clutch!” started the big aeroplane on its flight of
rescue.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a swift, wobbling motion that threw Billy
from side to side of the car the <em>Golden Eagle II</em>, under
the direction of her unskilled pilot, skidded across the
top of the mound-builders’ island while Quatty waved
his arm in farewell.</p>

<p class='c009'>Unaccustomed as he was to the <em>Golden Eagle II</em>,
Lathrop made his first mistake when he tried to raise
her after too short a run. To his despair and amazement
she refused to rise when he raised his upward
planes. They were traveling over the ground at a
rapid speed, now with the two big propellers threshing
the air at a rate of 1200 revolutions a minute; the roar
of the exhaust was like the discharge of a score of
gatling guns.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lathrop set his teeth desperately and jerked the
planes at an even acuter angle in his effort to get her
to rise. They were only a few yards from the edge
of the mound now and if she refused to rise by the
time they reached it they would be inevitably dashed
down to death in the ruins of the big sky-skimmer.
With that desperate determination that comes in the
face of crucial emergency, Lathrop threw in another
speed on the engine and they attained a velocity of
1500 revolutions a minute.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll make her rise or bust,” he said grimly to himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the end he feared did not come; under the added
impetus of her increased speed and the acute angle at
which the boy had set the rising planes the <em>Golden
Eagle II</em> shot into the air, as abruptly as a sky-rocket,
as she reached the edge of the mound. The result for
an instant, however, threatened to be almost as
serious as if she had gone over the edge without
rising.</p>

<p class='c009'>In his excitement Lathrop had set the rising planes
at such an abrupt angle that when the ship shot up she
reared like a horse, hurling Billy Barnes back among
the engines and almost overboard and causing Lathrop
to let go of his steering wheel for the fragment of a
second to grasp a stanchion. At the same instant the
aeroplane, left unguided for a second, gave a sickening
plunge sideways, like a wounded hawk. Lathrop
in his agitation seized the wheel and gave it a twist
that brought her round, it is true, but as her starboard
propeller was working in direct opposition to the curve
he wished her to describe, he almost twisted her
rudder off and made her careen at just as alarming
an angle in the opposite direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>To Billy it looked as if they were gone but Lathrop,
who was fast learning the peculiarities of the craft he
had under his control, managed by a skillful manipulation
to right her and the next minute with her propellers
beating the air at top speed the big craft dashed
forward as steadily as an ocean liner. It had been a
narrow escape, though, and taught Lathrop something
about navigating a twin screw air-ship. In a craft of
this kind, in a maneuver executed to port, the course
of the ship is bound to receive a backward pull from
the starboard propeller and vice versa. It is necessary
for the operator, then to swing in an easy curve to
avoid pulling his steering gear out by the roots and
being dashed to death.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s only the overture,” cried Lathrop, exhilarated
by the rapid motion as they rushed toward
the island, “wait for the big show.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <br />HEMMED IN BY FLAMES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the meantime in the noisome dungeon in which
they lay, Frank and Harry Chester, and the officer
they had struggled so bravely for, had given up all
hope of ever seeing the light of day again. As nearly
as they could calculate it was twelve hours or more
since Bellman had thrust his head into their place of
confinement and shouted that he would give them a
last chance if they would tell him where the <em>Golden
Eagle II</em> lay and where their companions were encamped.
The boys, though faint from lack of food
and almost dead with thirst, refused and Bellman with
a savage curse had slammed the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a time they had heard tramping about overhead
as if there were last hasty preparations being
made for the departure and then all grew silent as a
grave. At that time, however, their fears were not
so much that they were to be left behind to be starved
in this black hole, as they had implicit faith in the man
to whom Frank had given the Buddha. Time and
again Harry, whose voice was growing momentarily
fainter, had murmured to Frank:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t think he will fail us, Frank?” and
Frank, although his own faith was beginning to
diminish as the hours went by, had always responded
reassuringly. He pointed out cheerfully—or as cheerfully
as he could—that to the Oriental mind an oath
made in the manner in which the red-banded serang
had made it was sacred and to be obeyed at all hazards.
Anything might have happened to delay the man’s
coming, he argued, and there was no doubt that he
would appear in due course and redeem his promise.
Frank’s thoughts belied his cheerful words, however.
There were a dozen things beside the breaking of his
oath that might have caused the serang to be unable
to liberate as he had promised. As the time passed by
the conviction steadily grew in Frank’s mind that
they had been deserted and that the three miserable
occupants of the dungeon were at that moment the
only living things on the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for the lieutenant, he was sunk in a sort of coma
in which it is doubtful, if he felt anxiety or any other
emotion. He seemed stupefied by his sufferings after
his first returning dawn of reason.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly, and when the boys’ hopes had reached
their lowest ebb they were startled by the sound of
footsteps walking above them. They shouted at the
top of their voices and the footsteps ceased. Then
they began again. Who could it be?</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment the idea of a rescue party flashed
across Frank’s mind but he dismissed it as improbable.
Nobody could have heard of their flight or located
their place of captivity unless—Quatty!</p>

<p class='c009'>Could it have been possible that the negro had conveyed
word to their comrades of their plight. Frank
hastily communicated his idea to Harry, but Harry
dismissed it as improbable. Frank, too, agreed that
Quatty was far more likely to have saved himself than
to have bothered about them. How unjust they were
to the black we know.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there were certainly footsteps upstairs. The
boys shouted and shouted. Friend or foe it made little
difference to them. They were famished and even
their foes would surely not be so inhuman as to refuse
them food. Even the lieutenant aroused himself
and set up a poor, feeble cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hark, what is that they are shouting upstairs?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank! Frank! Harry, where are you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A second’s listening convinced the boys they were
not dreaming. Whoever was upstairs was shouting
their names. They set up redoubled shouts and shortly
after they heard hands fumbling at the lock of the
prison door. A few seconds later the lock having refused
to yield, the door came flying inward, burst from
its hinges by a tree-trunk cut and used as a battering
ram by Lathrop and Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The scene after the boys were reunited and Lieutenant
Chapin had been introduced may be imagined.
There surely was never a more joyful reunion nor in
more strange surroundings.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy described how after their flight from the
mound-builders’ island they had decided, after careful
reconnoitering, that the island was deserted. How
this had come about of course they did not know, and
were at first in despair as they concluded that the boys
and the lieutenant must have been taken to the coast
and carried off to slavery in the Far East. At the
actual baseness of Captain Bellman’s mind they had
not guessed till they found the prisoners.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had agreed, however, to land and explore the
island in the hope that they might find some clue to
their comrades, and with that intention had descended
to the large open space where the reducing operations
had been carried on. In course of time they had
arrived at the door of the big bunk-house and here had
made a startling discovery.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stretched across the door of the place was a dead
body.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what do you think, Frank?” exclaimed
Lathrop, “on examining it in one hand we found
tightly clutched a key and—here’s the extraordinary
part—in one of the pockets of the loose blouse he wore
we discovered a little green Buddha exactly like the
one the moonshiner sold you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor serang,” sighed Frank, “he did then try to
keep his word.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His words demanded an explanation and the boy
rapidly told the rescuers of the dead man’s oath to
release them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you had taken that key, Lathrop,” he concluded,
“you could have opened the door easily without
battering it down. Poor fellow—Bellman must
have caught him coming back here and guessing for
what purpose, he killed him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The first thing to do is get you out of these
stocks,” said Billy after he had detailed how, on hearing
the boys’ shouts, they had traced them to the cellar
in which they lay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not try the key,” suggested Billy, “it looked
a pretty big affair to me to fit the lock we found on
that door.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a good idea,” assented Lathrop. He was
up the stairs and back in a very short time and carried
with him the key that had been found in the dead man’s
hand. It fitted the stocks perfectly and furnished a
further proof that the serang had actually been on his
way to keep his promise when he was killed.</p>

<p class='c009'>A twist of it in the heavy padlock and the unfortunate
prisoners were at liberty with the exception of
their handcuffs. With a cold chisel and hammer Lathrop
struck these off. A few minutes later the boys
had been helped out of the dungeon into what had
been the blacksmith shop of Bellman’s gang. With
the exception of a great stiffness and soreness, occasioned
by their confinement, the prisoners were soon
as well as ever, and after a hearty meal from the provision
lockers of the <em>Golden Eagle II</em>, and a long
account from Lieutenant Chapin, who was rapidly
recovering, of his adventures, the boys were ready to
start.</p>

<p class='c009'>So interested had they been in talking, however,
and so rapidly had the time flown that they had not
looked about them or taken any note of anything but
each other. Now, however, when they looked up they
noticed a peculiar haze in the air and at the same time
became aware of a choking sort of feeling that made
their eyes sting and their nostrils itch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” asked Harry as they all noticed
these symptoms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank and Lieutenant Chapin were both on their
feet and had exchanged grave glances. From where
they had been seated they had not commanded a view
of the ’glades. Now, however, as the little party
hastily emerged they saw before them a sight that
chilled the blood of the boldest of them. For as far
as they could see, and sweeping down on them at terrible
speed, was a wall of flames.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Everglades were on fire!</p>

<p class='c009'>With a quick gasp Frank recollected the dried brush
he had noticed on the trail the day he and Harry left
the boat. He realized that if the flames reached the
island with such tinder to feed on they would sweep
it from end to end. The <em>Golden Eagle II</em> would be
destroyed and they doomed to a slow death from starvation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about the other side of the island? Perhaps
there is some way out there,” suggested the Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By the time we get there the flames would be
roaring up the hillside here,” he said, “there is only
one thing to do. Run for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run for it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fly for it rather. In an hour’s time this island will
be a black charred ash-heap,” was Frank’s reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Frank,” was Harry’s exclamation, “the
<em>Golden Eagle II</em> will only carry four, and then she is
overburdened, and there are five of us here!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s got to carry us,” said Frank grimly, “or
we’ll be burned to crisps, or starved if we escape death
by fire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lighten her,” was the quiet reply, “dump overboard
every ounce of weight we can spare.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Feverishly the little party went about the work.
First the transoms were ruthlessly ripped out and
thrown aside. Then came the provisions and other
equipment, and lastly even the navigating instruments.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s lightened her about 150 pounds,” pronounced
Frank. “We’ll try her with that and if it
doesn’t work we’ll have to tear out the wireless and
let that go too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time the advance guard of the flames was
marching in a long ruthless line perilously close already
to the island. The dry saw-grass blazed like
tinder and the party on the island could distinctly hear
the hungry roar of the flames as they advanced. The
conflagration leaped the narrow water-courses as it
came to them like a steeplechaser and the numerous
runnels offered no more check to it than if they had
not been there.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the broad water-course, used by Bellman and
his men to get to and from the coast, did not check the
progress of the flames. There was a fair wind blowing
out of the northwest and before it red-hot brands
were whisked across the stream and ignited the dry
wastes on the other side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we don’t hurry,” exclaimed Frank, as his eye
took in this, “we shall be hemmed in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was a new peril. With the flames only on
one side they might have hoped to escape but if the
blaze ringed the island in there would be grave danger
in trying to cross it in their overburdened air-ship.
For one thing the strange cross-currents created by a
fire are alone enough to throw an aeroplane onto dangerous
angles and Frank, as he gazed at the height to
which the flames were leaping, added to this menace
the fear that the overladen ship would not be able to
rise high enough to clear them. What that meant
there was no need for him to tell the others—he did
not dare to entertain such a thought himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>With all the speed they made the flames were swifter
and by the time they had all scrambled into the chassis
the island was surrounded by roaring flames and the
hungry fire was beginning to attack the dried brush on
its sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can we make it?” gasped Lathrop as he gazed at
the terrifying spectacle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got to make it,” snapped Frank as Harry
started the engine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The atmosphere was by this time so obscured by
choking smoke that it was as thick and dark as a fog.
Water streamed from the boys’ eyes and noses and
they speedily found that every breath they took seared
their lungs as though a red-hot iron had been plunged
into them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even if they could weather the flames, could they
get through such smoke alive?</p>

<p class='c009'>With a prayer on his lips Frank started the <em>Golden
Eagle II</em> into the awful smothering pall. He could
not see a foot in front of him and, indeed, in a second
his eyes were blinded by the acrid reek.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got to do it, we’ve got to do it,” he kept
saying to himself through clenched teeth as he drove
the aeroplane full into the inferno. It was as dark as
night and as hot as a furnace mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caught in the currents generated by the heat the
aeroplane swayed and zigzagged drunkenly. Frank,
his eyes closed and drawing every breath with agony,
clutched the wheel till the varnish came off on his
hands. He could smell the scorching paint of
<em>The Golden Eagle II</em> as the awful heat blistered it.</p>

<p class='c009'>It flashed across his mind that the cloth covering
the planes might catch and then? Somehow nothing
seemed to matter much then to the dazed, half-suffocated
boy, only one clear idea presented itself repeating
over and over with trip-hammer regularity:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep going ahead.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic005'>
<a href='images/illus-304.jpg'><img src='images/illus-304.jpg' alt='' class='ig005' /></a>
<p>The dash through the flames in the Everglades.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But were they going ahead? Frank did not know.
So badly was the craft handicapped by her weight
and in such a whirl of heat-engendered air currents
was she caught that it was difficult for Frank, blinded
as he was, to tell.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly she gave a swoop down.</p>

<p class='c009'>Was it the end?</p>

<p class='c009'>No, she righted herself, more by instinct on
Frank’s part than anything. The blinded, choked,
helmsman jerked up her rising planes. But the next
minute she repeated the blundering stagger downward
and Frank realized, even in his dazed state, that
she would never rise again if she wasn’t lightened.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wireless! That would have to go.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a cracked voice that sounded like a ghost of
his usual hearty tones, Frank shouted back the command.
But there was no response. Temporarily he
checked the aeroplane’s downward tendency but he
knew that the next time she would drop into the
flames in spite of him and shrivel up with her passengers
like a handful of flax.</p>

<p class='c009'>Blinded by smoke, with cracked lips and swollen
tongue Frank realized that something must have happened
to the others. With one hand on the steering
wheel, he reached back and seized the wireless-box by
its base. It weighed 165 pounds and if he could get
it free it meant their salvation.</p>

<p class='c009'>He tugged with all the strength in his arms. The
case moved slightly on its base. Frank knew the
screws that held it in place did not reach very deep,
but with one hand he could not manage to tear it
loose.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he did a daring thing. Setting the rising
planes at their full upward tendency he left the wheel
locked by its spring gear and reeled with outstretched
hands toward the apparatus. Once he tugged,—twice
he tugged.</p>

<p class='c009'>The box was coming loose but the aeroplane was
sagging, he could feel it. It was getting hotter, too.</p>

<p class='c009'>With bursting brain and blistered hands he heaved
at the box till the blood ran from under his nails.</p>

<p class='c009'>Would it never come?</p>

<p class='c009'>With an effort that seemed to crack his shoulders,
Frank gave a mighty heft. The box ripped loose
with a suddenness that sent him staggering back; but
the next minute he recovered his balance and heaved
it overboard into the roaring vortex beneath them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, with the instinct born of necessity, he groped
his way to the wheel and as he set the <em>Golden
Eagle II</em> on a rising course he realized that she was
responding and they were saved.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ten minutes later they emerged into the blessed
air that, though still smoke-filled, above the fire-swept
flats was still breathable. With blackened face and
singed hair and eyebrows, Frank felt the difference,
although his eyes were still closed and giving him
agony. He inhaled it in great breaths of delight,
saturating his lungs in its comparative freshness.
Finally, when he could open his eyes, he looked back
for the others.</p>

<p class='c009'>They lay on the floor senseless, smoke-blackened,
without motion.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the <em>Golden Eagle II</em> under Frank’s guidance
had passed the ordeal of flame and as she skimmed
through the cooler air the unconscious members of the
party, one by one recovered and grasped the hand of
the boy who had saved them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVIII' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br /> <br />THE BLACK AEROPLANE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Tarantula</em>, black, grim and business-like, lay
at anchor off the mouth of the Jew-Fish River, her
long, lean form rising and falling on the heavy swells
and a curl of black smoke lazily issuing from each of
her four black funnels, the foremost one of which was
striped with four yellow bands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Forward her crew lay about and loafed or fished,
while aft Lieutenant Selby and the ensigns assigned
to the command with him, paced the deck, looking
from time to time into the wireless room to ascertain
if any news had been heard from the boys. The answer
each time was in the negative and hourly the
naval officer’s apprehension grew. What could be
the matter? If everything had gone well he should
certainly have heard from them by now.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the submarine, also, nothing had been seen and
this fact encouraged the young officer to believe that
she was still up the river somewhere. A bright
lookout had been kept day and night since Frank’s
wireless announcing the discovery of Captain Bellman’s
destination, but nothing had been seen of the
expected craft. That she had utilized her diving apparatus
and passed unnoticed in that way was unlikely
as the water in which the <em>Tarantula</em> lay, was
shoal even for her and the soundings that the lieutenant
had made the day before showed that it
would have been impossible for the submarine to have
passed out in any other way but the main channel.
So with steam up the <em>Tarantula</em> swung at her anchor
and waited like a patient cat, watching an opportunity
to pounce on a mouse. The idea of entering the river
in boats and scouting for the submarine had entered
the lieutenant’s head, but after consideration he
had abandoned it. To reveal his presence to Bellman
might spoil everything and as it was if the
submarine was in the river, she was securely
bottled up.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hours slowly passed on and still no word came.
Evening set in and the wireless was still silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If those young rascals haven’t shown up by tomorrow
morning, Bagsby, I shall be sorely tempted
to head an expedition myself and go in search of
them,” declared Selby—on whom the strain of the
long wait was wearing—to one of his ensigns.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Air-ship! dead off our bow, sir!” suddenly hailed
the lookout forward; who, like everybody else, had
been keeping a watch all day for some signs of the
boys’ craft.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By Jove, so it is!” exclaimed the lieutenant, bringing
his glasses to bear.</p>

<p class='c009'>High in the evening sky above the tangle of islands
an air-craft was winging its way toward them. At
first sight a mere speck, she grew rapidly larger as she
neared the shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what can have happened to her?” exclaimed
the lieutenant as the first vague blot of the ship resolved
through his glasses into definite lines, “here,
take a look, Bagsby.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He handed the glasses to his subordinate, who
laid them aside in a few minutes with the exclamation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, she’s as black as a coal, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that dangling at her stern, Bagsby?”
asked Lieutenant Selby the next minute.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, it looks like an American flag, sir,”
responded the ensign, “but it’s almost as black as the
rest of her and—just look at that, sir—the men in
her all black, too!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hardly able to control his excitement the lieutenant
took the glasses from his subordinate, though by this
time the air-vessel was so close that the five persons
aboard her were visible to the naked eye. They were
waving furiously and shouting at the tops of their
voices, though these sounded, to tell the truth, a bit
feeble.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Tarantula</em>, ahoy!” came a hail from the aeroplane,
as she swung in a graceful circle about the destroyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahoy there,” hailed the lieutenant through a
megaphone, “who are you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The <em>Golden Eagle II</em>, Captain Frank Chester,”
came back from the aeroplane as she swung by,
“with Lieutenant Bob Chapin, aboard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The cheer that went up then roused the herons that
were just settling down to bed and sent them and a
hundred other varieties of Everglade birds swirling in
wild affright up around the tree-tops. As for
Selby he clapped Bagsby on the back till the young
ensign sustained a violent fit of coughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Chapin and he’s safe; hurray!” he shouted.
“Those boys have done the trick!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Send a boat ashore for us,” shouted the leader
of the adventurers from the smoke-blackened ’plane,
as she swung by once more, “we’ve got a lot to tell
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think so,” commented the lieutenant to
himself, as he ordered a boat lowered and seated himself
in the stern sheets. While this was being done
the boys had landed on a long sandy bar, which made
an ideal grounding place. It didn’t take long, you
may be sure, to get them into the boat and row them
aboard the <em>Tarantula</em> where, after soap and towel had
removed their sooty disguise, they made a meal that
tasted to them infinitely more delicious than any of
the more elaborate repasts any of them had ever eaten
in New York. As for Lieutenant Chapin, to be once
more aboard one of Uncle Sam’s ships and in the
hands of friends, affected him to such a degree that
after dinner he begged to be excused and paced in
solitude up and down the deck for an hour or more,
while Frank told and retold the story of their adventures.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the lieutenant was gratefully recalling the
boys’ exploit, he was awakened from his reverie by
the splash of a paddle and looking up saw a canoe
drawing near in which were seated three people. It
was too dark of course for him to make out more than
the outlines of their figures.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boat ahoy! What boat’s that?” hailed the lookout
sharply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we ain’t got no name but an Injun one and
I disremember that,” came back the reply, “but tell
me have you got two young chaps, named Chester,
aboard?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is that?” hailed the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My name’s Ben Stubbs. Who the dickens are
you?” was the bluff reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lieutenant Chapin,” was the calm reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>The result was astonishing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’ll be double horn-swoggled,” shouted the
same bluff voice that had framed the question and the
next minute there was a splash and loud sputtering
sounds of indignation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Man overboard!” cried the <em>Tarantula’s</em> lookout.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You black landlubbers! Upsetting me overboard
and trying to drown me, eh? Ef I had you
at a rope’s end I’d make you walk fancy,” came
over the water in tones running the gamut of indignation.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time the boys and the others were on deck
and as they heard and amazedly recognized the sputtering
voice there came from them a delighted hail of:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ben Stubbs!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come aboard!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure I will if this consarned contraption of a
canoe we’re in wull hold me an’ my voice, but
every time I speak it tips over,” was the indignant
reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there were no more accidents and a few seconds
later the boys and the dripping Ben were wringing
hands and slapping backs till the tears came to the
rugged old adventurer’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keelhaul me if I ain’t glad to see you,” shouted
Ben, “and the lootinant, too. I knowed they’d git yer
ef they set out to,” roared Ben, “and by the great
horn-spoon, they have.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While this was going on the two other occupants
of the boat—who were none other than Quatty and
Pork Chops—had clambered on deck and stood shyly
by. They, too, came in for their share of greetings
and congratulations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Ben, of course, had to relate his adventures
with the Seminoles, winding up with the account of
how he came to leave the Indian village.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed that a wandering party of Seminoles had
come across Quatty, wearily paddling toward the
coast from the mound-builders’ island, and as he was
almost exhausted had taken him in their canoes and
poled him at top speed to the island. Arrived there
Quatty was roused to great indignation, as well as
surprise when he discovered that Ben was a captive
and demanded his immediate release. By virtue of
Quatty’s power over the tribesmen, Ben had immediately
been set free and he and Quatty canoed to Camp
Walrus. Here they found Pork Chops, half crazy
from fright and as he would not hear of being left
alone any longer they agreed to take him with them
to the <em>Tarantula</em>, whither Ben had decided to go as
soon as he found the camp deserted. The rest the
boys knew.</p>

<p class='c009'>The relation of Ben’s narrative, and of course that
of the boys which had to be retold to the newcomer,
consumed so much time that they were all startled
when eight bells (midnight) rang out.</p>

<p class='c009'>The echo had hardly died away when a black form
was seen rushing through the water from the mouth
of the river.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was sighted simultaneously by almost all on deck
and recognized at once for what it was.</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Bellman’s submarine!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIX' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /> <br />THE LAST OF BELLMAN’S CREW.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Up anchor, quick!” shouted Lieutenant Selby,
springing into the conning tower. The shrill whistle
of the bos’un’s pipe sounded at the same moment and
in a second the ship that had been so still and inert
was a maelstrom of activity. The anchor was broken
out and long before it was landed home at the catheads
the <em>Tarantula</em>, a long line of white foam streaking
aft from each side of her sharp bow, was steering
through the water in pursuit of the flying submarine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lieutenant Selby’s first action after they were
under way had been to order the searchlight played
on the chase and kept on her. Fortunately the phosphorescent
glow left on the water by the submarine,
as she dashed away, made her course as plain as day
and the man operating the searchlight had no difficulty
in finding her.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the light played about her the watchers on the
<em>Tarantula</em>, made out two forms standing on her
railed-in back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bellman!” exclaimed Frank as his eyes fell on
the taller of the two.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Foyashi, the scoundrel,” was Lieutenant Chapin’s
recognition of the shorter one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll get ’em if we blow the <em>Tarantula</em> up,” exclaimed
Lieutenant Selby tensely, as he shouted
down to the engineer, “more steam, Mac.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The pace was terrific, moreover it was dangerous
navigation, but everyone aboard well knew that they
would have to catch the submarine before she got out
of the waters where she did not dare to dive, and
there was not a man aboard that was not willing, in
the heat of the chase, to take the chance of running
aground.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lieutenant Selby himself had taken the wheel
from the man who had held it when the chase began
and like greyhound and hare the destroyer and the
submarine raced along.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Try them with the bow gun,” suggested Lieutenant
Chapin to his associate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A good idea, old man,” was the reply, and old
Bob Adams, a seamy-faced veteran, was called aft and
promised unlimited tobacco and spending money if
he could hit the submarine and “wing” her. Old
Adams was a man of few words and didn’t change
his usual habit of silence, as the gun was made ready
for him. It was a Hotchkiss rapid-fire capable of
piercing steel-armor at half-a-mile and the submarine’s
broad glistening back offered a good mark.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you ready, Adams?” asked the lieutenant,
as after a lot of squinting and adjustment the old
man stood with the firing cord in his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bin ready, tew minuts,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go ahead then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Hotchkiss spat viciously, but the water spurted
up a good ten feet of the mark.</p>

<p class='c009'>The shot had missed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Adams didn’t change a muscle of his face,
though he knew every eye on ship but that of the
helmsman was on him. He spat over the side, ruminatively,
and then pointed the gun, once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time Bellman and his companion had seen
there was mischief behind and had ducked through
the slide of their craft and screwed it down. The
lieutenant rightly interpreted this as a signal that in
a few minutes the submarine would dive. If once she
did so the chances against their getting her again
would be remote in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get her this time, Adams,” he beseeched.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll do my best, sir;” said the old salt as the gun
cracked once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>This time a cheer went up. The submarine had
been hit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Again! Let her have it!” yelled Lieutenant
Selby, carried away by excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again and again the Hotchkiss viciously cracked
and spat fire and every time brought the <em>Tarantula</em>
nearer to the crippled diver. It was evident that the
submarine could not last much longer. Already her
speed was a mere crawl. One of Adams’ projectiles
must have penetrated to her engine-room or else,—as
was more likely,—her crew had mutinied.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly the slide on her back opened and through
it poured a crowd of the little brown men who had
been employed at Bellman’s Island. They cried,
they screamed appeals of aid to the pursuing ship,
which had of course ceased firing as human figures
appeared.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They want us to take ’em aboard, sir,” said old
Adams, who had served in the far East and understood
their appeals. “They say they are sinking and that
their engineer is killed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lower the boats,” ordered Selby, “we’ll get them
off. I won’t see men drown if I can help it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A coatless man suddenly appeared among the searchlight
illumined crowd on the back of the submarine.
It was Bellman. By his side was Foyashi, also coatless
and desperate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Back, you yellow dogs. Get back below!” yelled
Bellman, flourishing a revolver.</p>

<p class='c009'>A beseeching cry went up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll go to the bottom together,” shouted Bellman,
apparently beside himself. The next instant his
revolver cracked and two of the little brown men fell
across the steel plates. What happened then was like
a nightmare to the boys who stood watching in horrified
amazement. The whole swarming crowd of
panic-stricken men seized Bellman and Foyashi and
paying no attention to their despairing cries hurled
them overboard.</p>

<p class='c009'>In vain the wretches tried to clasp the sides of the
wounded submarine and haul themselves back on deck.
They were knocked off each time by their crazed followers.
Before the boats from the <em>Tarantula</em> could
reach them they both had disappeared. In the submarine’s
engine-room Job Scudder, too, lay dead—killed
beside his engines at Adams’ first successful shot.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <em>Tarantula</em> anchored there for the night and the
boats rowed about seeking for the lost men but their
bodies did not reappear and doubtless the swift current
swept them out to sea. Early the next day the
boys and the officers rowed over to the submarine,
whose crew was now installed on board the <em>Tarantula</em>
and searched her thoroughly. She had settled in shallow
water and access to her was easy through the top
plate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their diligence was rewarded by the discovery in
a steel bound chest, that evidently had belonged to
Bellman, of the long missing formula of Chapinite.
They found, too, unmistakable proofs that the government
which the authorities had suspected all along had
really been the man’s employer. How he drifted into
their service, was, of course, only surmise. The submarine
was laden with four gross of straw-wrapped
boxes containing enough of the explosive to have blown
up the navies of the world, if mixed with the right
quantity of gunpowder. At Lieutenant Selby’s suggestion
the boxes were weighted and sunk to the bottom
of the Gulf of Mexico the next day where they still lie.
It was too dangerous a cargo to carry in the form the
daring Bellman had packed it.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Pork Chops and Quatty, before the <em>Tarantula</em>
sailed their hearts were made glad by presents
of rifles, revolvers and ammunition and permission to
take possession of the canoes and all the duffle the
boys had left at Camp Walrus. Pork Chops had been
so fascinated by Quatty’s tales of life among the
Seminoles that he had decided to cast in his lot with
him and, on condition that Quatty gave him a proper
introduction to the tribe, to go shares on the <em>Carrier
Dove</em> with him after they fetched her from her anchorage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ben Stubbs and the boys, in the <em>Tarantula’s</em> launch,
early the next day went back to the sand-spit where
the <em>Golden Eagle II</em> had been beached and dismantled
her, as soon as the inspection of the submarine was
completed. Packed in sections she was placed aboard
the destroyer together with the field wireless which
was fetched from Camp Walrus, by Lathrop and the
negroes.</p>

<p class='c009'>That evening just as the group of herons, to which
the boys had grown so accustomed, were circling
above their roosting-places, the <em>Tarantula</em> with a long
blast of her siren, swung out of the channel into the
shimmering gold of the Gulf. Behind them lay the
black outlines of the half-submerged submarine. Forward
on deck, squatted the little brown men who were
to be set ashore at the first convenient port, as they
all had plenty of money to get back to their own
country.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <em>Tarantula’s</em> destination was Hampton Roads,
from where the boys and Lieutenant Chapin were to
hurry to Washington and relate the whole story. As
for Billy Barnes, he was already busy writing out what
he called “The biggest beat of the ages, the recovery of
Lieutenant Chapin and the Loss of the Mysterious
Submarine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s good for a whole front page,” he declared,
“with pictures of all of us and ‘by William Barnes,’
at the top.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you thinking of, Frank, old boy?” asked
Harry as the destroyer plunged steadily forward
through the night,—homeward bound.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank laughed, although his thoughts had been
grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That we have earned a holiday,” he said, “let’s
go on a hunting trip, some place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where?” inquired Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, anywhere—what’s the matter with Africa?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great! hunting by aeroplane!” exclaimed Harry,
“and we’ll take the bunch along. Hurray! for the
BOY AVIATORS IN AFRICA; or, ON AN AERIAL IVORY TRAIL.”</p>

<p class='c014'><b>BEN STONE AT OAKDALE.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>Under peculiarly trying circumstances
Ben Stone wins his way at
Oakdale Academy, and at the
same time enlists our sympathy,
interest and respect. Through the
enmity of Bern Hayden, the loyalty
of Roger Eliot and the clever work
of the “Sleuth,” Ben is falsely accused,
championed and vindicated.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>BOYS OF OAKDALE ACADEMY.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>“One thing I will claim, and that
is that all Grants fight open and
square and there never was a sneak among them.” It was
Rodney Grant, of Texas, who made the claim to his friend,
Ben Stone, and this story shows how he proved the truth
of this statement in the face of apparent evidence to the
contrary.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>RIVAL PITCHERS OF OAKDALE.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>Baseball is the main theme of this interesting narrative,
and that means not only clear and clever descriptions of
thrilling games, but an intimate acquaintance with the
members of the teams who played them. The Oakdale
Boys were ambitious and loyal, and some were even disgruntled
and jealous, but earnest, persistent work won out.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>OAKDALE BOYS IN CAMP.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>The typical vacation is the one that means much freedom,
little restriction, and immediate contact with “all outdoors.”
These conditions prevailed in the summer camp of
the Oakdale Boys and made it a scene of lively interest.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE GREAT OAKDALE MYSTERY.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>The “Sleuth” scents a mystery! He “follows his nose.”
The plot thickens! He makes deductions. There are

<p class='c014'><b>NEW BOYS AT OAKDALE.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>A new element creeps into Oakdale with another year’s

<p class='c015'>Especially interesting and timely
is this book which introduces the
reader with its heroes, Ned and Herc,
to the great ships of modern warfare
and to the intimate life and surprising
adventures of Uncle Sam’s sailors.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS ABOARD A DESTROYER.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>In this story real dangers threaten
and the boys’ patriotism is tested in
a peculiar international tangle. The scene is laid on the
South American coast.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS ON A SUBMARINE.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>To the inventive genius—trade-school boy or mechanic—this
story has special charm, perhaps, but to every reader its
mystery and clever action are fascinating.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS ON AERO SERVICE.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>Among the volunteers accepted for Aero Service are Ned

<p class='c014'><b>THE BORDER BOYS ACROSS THE FRONTIER.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>Read of the Haunted Mesa and its
mysteries, of the Subterranean River

feel that not even the ancient splendors of the Old World

<p class='c014'><b>THE BORDER BOYS WITH THE MEXICAN RANGERS.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>As every day is making history—faster, it is said, than

are full of rapid action and accurate facts. This book
deals with lively times on the Mexican border.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE BORDER BOYS WITH THE TEXAS RANGERS.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>The Border Boys have already had much excitement
and adventure in their lives, but all this has served to

<p class='c014'><b>THE BUNGALOW BOYS.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>How the Bungalow Boys received
their title and how they retained the
right to it in spite of much opposition
makes a lively narrative for lively boys.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE BUNGALOW BOYS MAROONED IN THE TROPICS.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>A real treasure hunt of the most
thrilling kind, with a sunken Spanish
galleon as its object, makes a
subject of intense interest at any
time, but add to that a band of desperate men, a dark plot
and a devil fish, and you have the combination that brings
strange adventures into the lives of the Bungalow Boys.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE BUNGALOW BOYS IN THE GREAT NORTHWEST.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>The clever assistance of a young detective saves the boys
from the clutches of Chinese smugglers, of whose nefarious
trade they know too much. How the Professor’s invention relieves
a critical situation is also an exciting incident of this book.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE BUNGALOW BOYS ON THE GREAT LAKES.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>The Bungalow Boys start out for a quiet cruise on the
Great Lakes and a visit to an island. A storm and a band
of wreckers interfere with the serenity of their trip, and a
submarine adds zest and adventure to it.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE BOY INVENTORS’ WIRELESS TELEGRAPH.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>Blest with natural curiosity,—sometimes
called the instinct of investigation,—favored
with golden
opportunity, and gifted with creative
ability, the Boy Inventors
meet emergencies and contrive
mechanical wonders that interest
and convince the reader because
they always “work” when put to
the test.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE BOY INVENTORS’ VANISHING GUN.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>A thought, a belief, an experiment; discouragement,
hope, effort and final success—this is the history of many
an invention; a history in which excitement, competition,
danger, despair and persistence figure. This merely suggests
the circumstances which draw the daring Boy Inventors
into strange experiences and startling adventures,
and which demonstrate the practical use of their vanishing
gun.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE BOY INVENTORS’ DIVING TORPEDO BOAT.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>As in the previous stories of the Boy Inventors, new
and interesting triumphs of mechanism are produced
which become immediately valuable, and the stage for
their proving and testing is again the water. On the
surface and below it, the boys have jolly, contagious fun,
and the story of their serious, purposeful inventions
challenge the reader’s deepest attention.</p>

<p class='c015'>How Frank’s summer experience

him into a sturdy young athlete

baseball contests, and a tramp
through the Everglades, is the
subject of this splendid story.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>FRANK ARMSTRONG AT QUEENS.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>We find among the jolly boys
at Queen’s School, Frank, the student-athlete, Jimmy, the
baseball enthusiast, and Lewis, the unconsciously-funny
youth who furnishes comedy for every page that bears
his name. Fall and winter sports between intensely rival
school teams are expertly described.</p>

<p class='c015'>With the same persistent determination that won him

Armstrong acquired the art of “drop kicking,” and the
Queen’s football team profits thereby.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE MOTOR MAIDS’ SCHOOL DAYS.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>Billie Campbell was just the type
of a straightforward, athletic girl
to be successful as a practical
Motor Maid. She took her car, as
she did her class-mates, to her
heart, and many a grand good time
did they have all together. The
road over which she ran her
red machine had many an unexpected
turning,—now it led her
into peculiar danger; now into contact
with strange travelers; and again into experiences
by fire and water. But, best of all, “The Comet” never
failed its brave girl owner.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE MOTOR MAIDS BY PALM AND PINE.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>Wherever the Motor Maids went there were lively times,
for these were companionable girls who looked upon the
world as a vastly interesting place full of unique adventures—and
so, of course, they found them.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE MOTOR MAIDS ACROSS THE CONTINENT.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>It is always interesting to travel, and it is wonderfully
entertaining to see old scenes through fresh eyes. It is
that privilege, therefore, that makes it worth while to join
the Motor Maids in their first ’cross-country run.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE MOTOR MAIDS BY ROSE, SHAMROCK AND HEATHER.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>South and West had the Motor Maids motored, nor
could their education by travel have been more wisely
begun. But now a speaking acquaintance with their own
country enriched their anticipation of an introduction to
the British Isles. How they made their polite American
bow and how they were received on the other side is a
tale of interest and inspiration.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>MOLLY BROWN’S FRESHMAN DAYS.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>Would you like to admit to your
circle of friends the most charming
of college girls—the typical college
girl for whom we are always looking
but not always finding; the type
that contains so many delightful
characteristics, yet without unpleasant
perfection in any; the
natural, unaffected, sweet-tempered
girl, loved because she is lovable?
Then seek an introduction to Molly
Brown. You will find the baggage-master, the cook, the
Professor of English Literature, and the College President
in the same company.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>MOLLY BROWN’S SOPHOMORE DAYS.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>What is more delightful than a re-union of college girls
after the summer vacation? Certainly nothing that precedes
it in their experience—at least, if all class-mates
are as happy together as the Wellington girls of this
story. Among Molly’s interesting friends of the second
year is a young Japanese girl, who ingratiates her “humbly”
self into everybody’s affections speedily and permanently.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>MOLLY BROWN’S JUNIOR DAYS.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>Financial stumbling blocks are not the only things that
hinder the ease and increase the strength of college girls.
Their troubles and their triumphs are their own, often
peculiar to their environment. How Wellington students
meet the experiences outside the class-rooms is worth the
doing, the telling and the reading.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE GIRL AVIATORS AND THE PHANTOM AIRSHIP.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>Roy Prescott was fortunate in
having a sister so clever and devoted
to him and his interests that
they could share work and play
with mutual pleasure and to mutual
advantage. This proved especially
true in relation to the manufacture
and manipulation of their aeroplane,
and Peggy won well deserved
fame for her skill and good
sense as an aviator. There were
many stumbling-blocks in their terrestrial path, but they
soared above them all to ultimate success.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE GIRL AVIATORS ON GOLDEN WINGS.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>That there is a peculiar fascination about aviation that
wins and holds girl enthusiasts as well as boys is proved
by this tale. On golden wings the girl aviators rose for
many an exciting flight, and met strange and unexpected
experiences.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE GIRL AVIATORS’ SKY CRUISE.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>To most girls a coaching or yachting trip is an adventure.
How much more perilous an adventure a “sky
cruise” might be is suggested by the title and proved by
the story itself.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>THE GIRL AVIATORS’ MOTOR BUTTERFLY.</b></p>

<p class='c015'>The delicacy of flight suggested by the word “butterfly,”
the mechanical power implied by “motor,” the ability to
control assured in the title “aviator,” all combined with
the personality and enthusiasm of girls themselves, make
this story one for any girl or other reader “to go crazy
over.”</p>
